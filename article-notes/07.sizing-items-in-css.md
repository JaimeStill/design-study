## The Natural or Intrinsic Size of Things
[Back to Top](#sizing-items-in-css)

HTML Elements have a natural size, set before they are affected by any CSS. A straightforward example is an image. An image has a width and a height defined in the image file it is embedding into the page. This size is described as the **intrinsic size** - which comes from teh image itself.

If you place an image on a page and do not change its height and width, either using attributes on the `<img>` tag or CSS, it will be displayed using that intrinsic size.

```css
img {
  border: 5px solid darkblue;
}
```

```html
<img src="star.png" alt="star">
```

An empty `<div>` however, has no size of its own. If you add a `<div>` to your HTML with no content, then give it a border, you will see a line on the page. This is the collapsed border on the element - there is no content to hold it open.

```css
.box {
  border: 5px solid darkblue;
}
```

```html
<div class="box"></div>
```

## Setting a Specific Size
[Back to Top](#sizing-items-in-css)

Elements can be given a specific size. When a size is given to an element (and the content of which then needs to fit into that size) we refer to it as an **extrinsic size**. We can give elements specific `width` and `height` values, and they will have that size no matter what content is placed them. A set heihgt can cause content to overflow if there is more content than the element has space to fit inside it. Due to this problem of overflow, fixing the height of elements with lengths or percentages is something we need to do very carefully on the web.

```css
.box {
  border: 5px solid darkblue;
  height: 150px;
  width: 280px;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box">These boxes both have a height set, this box has content in it which will need more space than the assigned height, and so we get overflow. </div>
</div>
```

### Using Percentages
[Back to Top](#sizing-items-in-css)

In many ways, percentages act like length units; they can often be used interchangeably with lengths. When using a percentage you need to be aware what it is a percentage *of*. In the case of a box inside another container, if you give the child box a percentage width it will be a percentage of the width of the parent container.

This is because percentages resolve against the size of the containing block. With no percentage applied our `<div>` would take up 100% of the available space, as it is a block level element. If we give it a percentage width, this becomes a percentage of the space it would normally fill.

```css
.box {
  border: 5px solid darkblue;
  width: 50%;
}
```

```html
<div class="box">I have a percentage width.</div>
```

[![percentage-width](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84416297-00a51980-abe2-11ea-9190-29d7a8031a08.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84416297-00a51980-abe2-11ea-9190-29d7a8031a08.png)

### Percentage Margins and Padding
[Back to Top](#sizing-items-in-css)

If you set `margins` and `padding` as a percentage, you may notice some strange behavior. Given a `margin` of 10% and a padding of 10%, the padding and margin on the top and bottom of the element are the same as the margin on the left and right.

You might expect, for example, the percentage top and bottom margins to be a percentage of the element's height, and the percentage left and right margins to be a percentage of the element's width. However, this is not the case!

When you use margin and padding set in percentages, the value is calculated from the **inline size** - therefore the width when working in a horizontal language. In this scenario, all of the margins and padding are 10% of the width. This means you can have equal-sized margins and padding all around the box.

> **Note**: This is a fact worth remembering if you do use percentages in this way.

```css
.box {
  border: 5px solid darkblue;
  width: 300px;
  margin: 10%;
  padding: 10%;
}
```

```html
<div class="box">
  I have margin and padding set to 10% on all sides.
</div>
```

## Min and Max Sizes
[Back to Top](#sizing-items-in-css)

In addition to giving things a fixed size, we can ask CSS to give an element a minimum or a maximum size. If you have a box that might contain a variable amount of content, and you always want it to be *at least* a certain height, you could set the [min-height](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-height) property on it. The box will always be at least this height, but will then grow taller if there is more content than the box has space for at its minimum height.

This is very useful for dealing with variable amounts of content while avoiding overflow.

```css
.box {
  border: 5px solid darkblue;
  min-height: 150px;
  width: 200px;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box">These boxes both have a min-height set, this box has content in it which will need more space than the assigned height, and so it grows from the minimum.</div>
</div>
```

[![min-height](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84417232-529a6f00-abe3-11ea-8b59-d09f38b1a0a7.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84417232-529a6f00-abe3-11ea-8b59-d09f38b1a0a7.png)

A common use of [max-width]() is to cause images to scale down if there is not enough space to display them at their intrinsic width while making sure they don't become larger than that width.

If you were to set `width: 100%` on an image, and its intrinsic width was smaller than its container, the image would be forced to stretch and become larger, causing it to look pixellated. If its intrinsic width were larger than its container, it would overflow it. Neither case is likely to be what you want to happen.

If you instead use `max-width: 100%`, the image is able to become smaller than its intrinsic size, but will stop at 100% of its size.

This technique is used to make images *responsive*, so that when viewed on a smaller device they scale down appropriately. You should however not use this technique to load in really large images and then scale them down in the browser. Images should be appropriately sized to be no larger than they need to be fore the largest size they are displayed in the design.

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
}
.minibox {
  width: 50px;
}
.width {
  width: 100%;
}
.max {
  max-width: 100%;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="box"><img src="star.png" alt="star" class="width"></div>
  <div class="box"><img src="star.png" alt="star" class="max"></div>
  <div class="minibox"><img src="star.png" alt="star" class="max"></div>
</div>
```

[![max-width](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84417624-e8ce9500-abe3-11ea-87c7-3446dfe8635d.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84417624-e8ce9500-abe3-11ea-87c7-3446dfe8635d.png)

## Viewport Units
[Back to Top](#sizing-items-in-css)

The viewport - which is the visible area of your page in the browser you are using to view a site - also has a size. In CSS we have units which relate to the size of the viewport - the `vw` unit for viewport width, and `vh` for viewport height. Using these units you can size something relative to the viewport of the user.

`1vh` is equal to 1% of the viewport height, and `1vw` is equal to 1% of the viewport width. You can use these units to size not only boxes, but also text.

Sizing things according to the viewport can be useful in your designs. For example, if you want a full-page hero section to show before the rest of your content, making that part of your page 100vh high will push the rest of the content below the viewport, meaning that it will only appear once the document is scrolled.

```css
.box {
  border: 5px solid darkblue;
  width: 20vw;
  height: 20vh;
  font-size: 10vh;
}
```

```html
<div class="box">
  A
</div>
```
