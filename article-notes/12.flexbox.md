## Background
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

The `Flexbox Layout` (Flexible Box) module aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and / or dynamic (thus the word "flex").

The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width / height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space and shrinks them to prevent overflow.

Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).

> **Note**: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) layout is intended for larger scale layouts.

## Basics and Terminology
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of thinkgs including its whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as "flex container") whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said "flex items").

If "regular" layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, the flex layout is based on "flex-flow directions". Please have a look at this figure from the specification, explaining the main idea behind the flex layout:

[![flex-layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443450-4b6a4e00-b55f-11ea-8afb-0f969b1d2939.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443450-4b6a4e00-b55f-11ea-8afb-0f969b1d2939.png)

Items will be laid out following either the `main axis` (from `main-start` to `main-end`) or the `cross axis` (from `cross-start` to `cross-end`).

* **main axis** - the main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out.
  * Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the `flex-direction` property (see below).
* **main-start** | **main-end** - the flex items are placed within the container starting from `main-start` and going to `main-end`.
* **main size** - A flex item's width or height, whichever is in the main dimensions, is the item's main size.
  * The flex item's main size property is either the `width` or `height` property, whichever is in the main dimension.
* **cross axis** - the axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis.
  * Its direction depends on the main axis direction.
* **cross-start** | **cross-end** - flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the `cross-start` side of the flex container and going toward the `cross-end` side.
* **cross size** - the width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item's cross size.
  * The cross size property is whichever of `width` or `height` that is in the cross dimension.

## Parent Properties
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

[![parent-container](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443532-5b822d80-b55f-11ea-950b-8283500c94bd.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443532-5b822d80-b55f-11ea-950b-8283500c94bd.png)

**flex container**

### display
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the value given. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.

```css
.container {
  display: flex | inline-flex;
}
```

> Note that CSS columns have no effect on a flex container.

### flex-direction
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

[![flex-direction](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443564-6a68e000-b55f-11ea-8107-372b45a51687.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443564-6a68e000-b55f-11ea-8107-372b45a51687.png)

This establishes the main axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. THink of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.

```css
.container {
  flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
}
```

* `row` (default): left to right in `ltr`; right to left in `rtl`
* `row-reverse`: right to left in `ltr`; left to right in `rtl`
* `column`: same as `row` but top to bottom
* `column-reverse`: same as `row-reverse` but bottom to top

### flex-wrap
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

[![flex-wrap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443605-781e6580-b55f-11ea-8c89-89061ea0eaef.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443605-781e6580-b55f-11ea-8c89-89061ea0eaef.png)

By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.

```css
.container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
}
```

* `nowrap` (default): all flex items will be on one line
* `wrap`: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom
* `wrap-reverse`: flex items will wrap onto multilpe lines from bottom to top

There are some [visual demos of `flex-wrap` here](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex-wrap/).

### flex-flow
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

This is a shorthand for the `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` properties, which together define the flex container's main and cross axes. The default value is `row nowrap`.

```css
.container {
  flex-flow: column wrap;
}
```

### justify-content
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

[![justify-content](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85442450-3214d200-b55e-11ea-8fdf-0a0a103a1e79.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85442450-3214d200-b55e-11ea-8fdf-0a0a103a1e79.png)

This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when eihter all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.

```css
.container {
  justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | start | end | left | right ... + safe | unsafe;
}
```

* `flex-start` (default): items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction.
* `flex-end`: items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction.
* `start`: items are packed toward the start of the `writing-mode` direction.
* `end`: items are packed toward the end of the `writing-mode` direction.
* `left`: items are pakced toward the left edge of the container, unless that doesn't make sense with the `flex-direction`, then it behaves like `start`.
* `right`: items are packed toward the right edge of the container, unless that doesn't make sense with the `flex-direction`, then it behaves like `start`.
* `center`: items are centered along the line.
* `space-between`: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line.
* `space-around`: items are evenyl distributed in the line with equal space around them.
  * Note that visually the spaces aren't equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.
* `space-evenly`: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edge) is equal.

Note that browser support for these values is nuanced. For example, `space-between` never got support from some versions of Edge, and `start`/`end`/`left`/`right` aren't in Chrome yet. MDN [has detailed charts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content). The safest values are `flex-start`, `flex-end`, and `center`.

There are also two additional keywords you can pair with these values: `safe` and `unsafe`. Using `safe` ensures that however you do this type of positioning, you can't push an element such that it renders off-screen (e.g. off the top) in such a way the content can't be scrolled too (called "data loss").

### align-items
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

[![align-items](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443661-88364500-b55f-11ea-8e0f-cb66c9468ea3.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443661-88364500-b55f-11ea-8e0f-cb66c9468ea3.png)

This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the **cross axis** on the current line. Think of it as the `justify-content` version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main axis).

```css
.container {
  align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | first baseline | last baseline | start | end | self-start | self-end + ... safe | unsafe;
}
```

* `stretch` (default): stretch to fill the container (still respect `min-width` / `max-width`).
* `flex-start` / `start` / `self-start`: items are placed at the start of the cross axis.
  * The difference between these is subtle, and is about respecting the `flex-direction` rules or the `writing-mode` rules.
* `flex-end` / `end` / `self-end`: items are placed at the end of the cross axis.
  * The difference again is subtle and is about respecting `flex-direction` rules vs. `writing-mode` rules.
* `center`: items are centered in the cross-axis.
* `baseline`: items are aligned such as their baselines align.

The `safe` and `unsafe` modifier keywords can be used in conjunction with all the rest of these keywords (although note [browser support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items)), and deal with helping you prevent aligning elements such that the content becomes inaccessible.

### align-content
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

[![align-content](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443719-9a17e800-b55f-11ea-8400-154597ad7a0d.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443719-9a17e800-b55f-11ea-8400-154597ad7a0d.png)

This aligns a flex container's lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how `justify-content` aligns individual items within the main-axis.

> **Note**: this property has no effect when there is only one line of flex items.

```css
.container {
  align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | stretch | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | start | end | baseline | first baseline | last baseline + ... safe | unsafe;
}
```

* `flex-start` / `start`: items packed to the start of the contianer.
  * The (more supported) `flex-start` honors the `flex-direction` while `start` honors the `writing-mode` direction.
* `flex-end` / `end`: items packed ot the end of the container.
  * The (more supported) `flex-end` honors the `flex-direction` whle end honors the `writing-mode` direction.
* `center`: items centered in the container.
* `space-between`: items evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end.
* `space-around`: items evenly distributed with equal space around each line.
* `space-evenly`: items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.
* `stretch` (default): lines stretch to take up the remaining space.

The `safe` and `unsafe` modifier keywords can be used in conjunction with all the rest of these keywords (although note [browser support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items)), and deal with helping you prevent aligning elements such that the content becomes inaccessible.

## Children Properties
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

[![flex-items](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443797-aac85e00-b55f-11ea-8995-bf4b3d985848.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443797-aac85e00-b55f-11ea-8995-bf4b3d985848.png)

**flex items**

### order
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

[![order](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443956-d6e3df00-b55f-11ea-97b4-744206ee345f.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85443956-d6e3df00-b55f-11ea-97b4-744206ee345f.png)

By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the `order` property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.

```css
.item {
  order: 5; /* default is 0 */
}
```

### flex-grow
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

[![flex-grow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85444027-e82ceb80-b55f-11ea-8e8d-e2ece522589f.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85444027-e82ceb80-b55f-11ea-8e8d-e2ece522589f.png)

This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of available space inside the flex container the item should take up.

If all items have `flex-grow` set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, the element would take up twice as much remaining space as the others (or it will try to, at least).

```css
.item {
  flex-grow: 4; /* default 0 */
}
```

Negative numbers are invalid.

### flex-shrink
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.

```css
.item {
  flex-shrink: 3; /* default 1 */
}
```

Negative numbers are invalid.

### flex-basis
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. `20%`, `5rem`, etc.) or a keyword. The `auto` keyword means "look at my width or height property" (which was temporarily done by the `main-size` keyword until deprecated). The `content` keyword means "size it based on the item's content" - this keyword isn't well supported yet, so it's hard to test and harder to know what it's brethren `max-content`, `min-content`, and `fit-content` do.

```css
.item {
  flex-basis: {length} | auto; /* default auto */
}
```

If set to `0`, the extra space around content isn't factored in. If set to `auto`, the extra space is distributed based on its `flex-grow` value. [See this graphic.](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/images/rel-vs-abs-flex.svg)

### flex
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

This is the shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis` combined. The second and third parameters (`flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`) are optional. The default is `0 1 auto`, but if you set it with a single nubmer value, it's like `1 0`.

```css
.item {
  flex: none | [{flex-grow} {flex-shrink}? || {flex-basis}]
}
```

**It is recommended that you use this shorthand property** rather than set the individual properties. The shorthand sets the other values intelligently.

### align-self
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

[![align-self](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85444085-fc70e880-b55f-11ea-81d0-a819eb4e59e2.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85444085-fc70e880-b55f-11ea-81d0-a819eb4e59e2.png)

This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by `align-items`) to be overridden for individual flex items.

Please see the `align-items` explanation to understand the available values.

```css
.item {
  align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
}
```

> **Note**: `float`, `clear`, and `vertical-align` have no effect on a flex item.

## Examples
[Back to Top](#flexbox)

Let's start with a very very simple example, solving an almost daily problem: perfect centering. It couldn't be any simpler if you use flexbox.

```css
.parent {
  display: flex;
  height: 300px;
}

.child {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: auto;
}
```

This relies on the fact that a margin set to `auto` in a flex container absorbs extra space. So setting a vertical margin of `auto` will make the item perfectly centered in both axes.

Now let's use some more properties. Consider a list of 6 items, all with fixed dimensions, but can be auto-sized. We want them to be evenly distributed on the horizontal axis so that when we resize the browser, everything scales nicely, and without media queries.

```css
.flex-container {
  /* first create a flex layout context */
  display: flex;

  /*
    Then, define the flow direction
    and whether to allow items to wrap.
    Remember this is the same as:
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  */
  flex-flow: row wrap;

  /* Then, define how to distribute the remaining space */
  justify-content: space-around;
}
```

Done. Everything else is just some styling concern.

[![space-around](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85543482-1c4bef00-b5e8-11ea-9b1c-6a50a27fbdfe.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85543482-1c4bef00-b5e8-11ea-9b1c-6a50a27fbdfe.png)

Let's try something else. Imagine we have a right-aligned navigation element on the very top of our website, but we want it to be centered on medium-sized screens and single-columned on small devices. Easy enough.

```css
/* large screens */
.navigation {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow; row wrap;

  /* this aligns items to the end of the main-axis line */
  justify-content: flex-end;
}

/* medium screens */
@media all and (max-width: 800px) {
  .navigation {
    /*
      on medium screens, center it by evenly
      distributing empty space around items.
    */
    justify-content: space-around;
  }
}

/* small screens */
@media all and (max-width: 500px) {
  .navigation {
    /*
      on small screens, we are no longer
      using row direction but column
    */
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

Let's try something even better by playing with flex items flexibility. What about a mobile-first 3-columns layout with full-width header and footer. And independent from source order.

```css
.wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
}

/* tell all items to be 100% width, via flex-basis */
.wrapper > * {
  flex: 1 100%;
}

/*
  rely on source order for mobile-first approach.
  in this case:
  1. header
  2. article
  3. aside 1
  4. aside 2
  5. footer
*/

/* medium screens */
@media all and (min-width: 600px) {
  /* tell both sidebars to share a row */
  .aside { flex: 1 auto; }
}

/* large screens */
@media all and (min-width: 800px) {
  /*
    invert order of first sidebar and main
    and tell the main element to take twice
    as much width as the other two sidebars.
  */
  .main { flex: 2 0px; }
  .aside-1 { order: 1; }
  .main { order: 2; }
  .aside-2 { order: 3; }
  .footer { order: 4; }
}
```
