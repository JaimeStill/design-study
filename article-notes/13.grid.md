## Introduction
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

CSS Grid Layout (aka "Grid"), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces. CSS has always been used to layou out our web pages, but it's never done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance). Flexbox helped out, but it's intended for simpler one-dimensional layouts, not complex two-dimensional ones (Flexbox and Grid actually work very well together). Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we've all been hacking our way around for as long as we've been making websites.

## Basics
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

To get started, you have to:

1. Define a container element as a grid with [display: grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-display).

2. Set the column and row sizes with [grid-template-columns](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows) and [grid-template-rows](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows).

3. Place its child elements in the grid with [grid-column](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row) and [grid-row](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row).

Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn't matter. Your CSS can place them in any order, which makes it super easy to rearrange your grid with media queries. Imagine defining the layout of your entire page, and then completely rearranging it to accommodate a different screen width all with only a couple lines of CSS. Grid is one of the most powerful CSS modules ever introduced.

## Important Terminology
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

Before diving into the concepts of Grid, it's important to understand the terminology. Since the terms involved here are kind of conceptually similar, it's easy to confuse them with one another if you don't first memorize their meanings defined by the Grid specification. But don't worry, there aren't many of them.

### Grid Container
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

The element on which `display: grid` is applied. It's the direct parent of all the grid items. In this example, `container` is the grid container.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="item item-1"></div>
  <div class="item item-2"></div>
  <div class="item item-3"></div>
</div>
```

### Grid Line
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical ("column grid lines") or horizontal ("row grid lines") and reside on either side of a row or column. Here the yellow line is an example of a column grid line:

[![column-grid-line](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-line.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-line.svg)

### Grid Track
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

The space between two adjacent grid lines. You can think of them like the columns or rows of the grid. Here's the grid track between the second and third row grid lines:

[![grid-track](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-track.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-track.svg)

### Grid Area
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

The total space surrounded by four grid lines. A grid area may be composed of any number of grid cells. Here's the grid area between row grid lines 1 and 3, and column grid lines 1 and 3:

[![grid-area](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-area.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-area.svg)

### Grid Item
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

The children (i.e. *direct* descendents) of the grid container. Here the `item` elements are grid items, but `sub-item` isn't.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="item"></div>
  <div class="item">
    <p class="sub-item"></p>
  </div>
  <div class="item"></div>
</div>
```

### Grid Cell
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines. It's a single "unit" of the grid. Here's the grid cell between row grid lines 1 and 2, and column grid lines 2 and 3:

[![grid-cell](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-cell.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-cell.svg)

## The Most Powerful Lines in Grid
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

Fluid width columns that break into more or less columns as space is available, with no media queries!

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));

  /*
    this is better for small screens,
    once min() is better supported:
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(min(200px, 100%), 1fr));
  */
  grid-gap: 1rem;
  /*
    this is the standardized property now,
    but has slightly less support:
    grid: 1rem;
  */

}
```

*[See on CodePen](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/xBmYJN)*

## Parent - Grid Container
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

### display
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

Defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents.

Values:

* **grid** - generates a block-level grid
* **inline-grid** - generates an inline-level grid

```css
.container {
  display: grid | inline-grid;
}
```

> **Note**: The ability to pass grid parameters down through nested elements (aka subgrids) has been moved to [level 2 of the CSS Grid specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#subgrids). Here's [a quick explanation](https://css-tricks.com/grid-level-2-and-subgrid/).

### grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

Defines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values. The values represent the track size, and the space between them represents the grid line.

Values:

* `{track-size}` - can be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space in the grid (using the [fr](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#fr-unit) unit)

* `{line-name}` - an arbitrary name of your choosing

```css
.container {
  grid-template-columns: ... | ...;
  grid-template-rows: ... | ...;
}
```

Examples:

When you leave an empty space between the track values, the grid lines are automatically assigned positive and negative numbers:

```css
.container {
  grid-template-columns: 40px 50px auto 50px 40px;
  grid-template-rows: 25% 100px auto;
}
```

[![grid-layout](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/template-columns-rows-01.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/template-columns-rows-01.svg)

But you can choose to explicitly name the lines. Note the bracket syntax for the line names:

```css
.container {
  grid-template-columns: [first] 40px [line2] 50px [line3] auto [col4-start] 50px [five] 40px [end];
  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25% [row1-end] 100px [third-line] auto [last-line];
}
```

[![named-grid-layout](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/template-column-rows-02.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/template-column-rows-02.svg)

Note that a line can have more than one name. For example, here the second line will have two names: `row1-end` and `row2-start`;

```css
.container {
  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25% [row1-end row2-start] 25% [row2-end];
}
```

If your definition contains repeating parts, you can use the `repeat()` notation to streamline things:

```css
.conatiner {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 20px, [col-start]);
}
```

Which is equivalent to this:

```css
.container {
  grid-template-columns: 20px [col-start] 20px [col-start] 20px [col-start];
}
```

If multiple lines share thes ame name, they can be referenced by their line name and count.

```css
.item {
  grid-column-start: col-start 2;
}
```

The `fr` unit allows you to set the size of a track as a fraction of the free space and the grid container. For example, this will set each item to one third the width of the grid container:

```css
.container {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}
```

The free space is calculated *after* any non-flexible items. In this example the total amount of free space available to the `fr` units doesn't include the 50px:

```css
.container {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 50px 1fr 1fr;
}
```

### grid-template-areas
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

Defines a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas which are specified with the [grid-area]() property. Repeating the name of a grid area causes the content to span those cells. A period signifies an empty cell. The syntax itself provides a visualization of the structure of the grid.

Values:

* `{grid-area-name}` - the name of a grid area specified with [grid-area](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-area)

* `.` - a period signifies an empty grid cell

* **none** - no grid areas are defined

```css
.container {
  grid-template-areas:
    " | . | none | ..."
    "...";
}
```

Example:

```css
.item-a {
  grid-area: header;
}

.item-b {
  grid-area: main;
}

.item-c {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}

.item-d {
  grid-area: footer;
}

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px 50px 50px;
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header header"
    "main main . sidebar"
    "footer footer footer footer";
}
```

That'll create a grid that's four columns wide by three rows tall. The entire top row will be composed of the **header** area. The middle rwo will be composed of two **main** areas, one empty clel, and one **sidebar** area. The last row is all **footer**.

[![grid-areas](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dddgrid-template-areas.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dddgrid-template-areas.svg)

Each row in your declaration needs to have the same number of cells.

You can use any number of adjacent periods to declare a single empty cell. As long as the periods have no spaces between them they represent a single cell.

Notice that you're not naming lines with this syntax, just areas. When you use this syntax, the lines on either end of the areas are actually getting named automatically. If the name of your grid area is ***foo***, the name of the area's starting row line and starting column line will be ***foo*-start**, and the name of its last row line and last column line will be ***foo*-end**. This means that some lines might have multiple names, such as the far left line in the above example, which will have three names: `header-start`, `main-start`, and `footer-start`.

### grid-template
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

A shorthand for setting [grid-template-rows](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows), [grid-template-columns](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows), and [grid-template-areas](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-areas) in a single declaration.

Values:

* **none** - sets all three properties to their initial values

* `{grid-template-rows}` / `{grid-template-columns}` - sets [grid-template-columns](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows) and [grid-template-rows](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows) to the specified values, respecitvely, and sets [grid-template-areas](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-areas) to none

```css
.container {
  grid-template: none | {grid-template-rows} / {grid-template-columns};
}
```

It also accepts a more complex but quite handy syntax for specifying all three. Here's an example:

```css
.container {
  grid-template:
    [row1-start] "header header header" 25px [row1-end]
    [row2-start] "footer footer footer" 25px [row2-end]
    / auto 50px auto;
}
```

That's equivalent to this:

```css
.container {
  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25px [row1-end row2-start] 25px [row2-end];
  grid-template-columns: auto 50px auto;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header"
    "footer footer footer";
}
```

Since `grid-template` doesn't reset the *implicit* grid properties ([grid-auto-columns](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-columns-rows), [grid-auto-rows](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-columns-rows), and [grid-auto-flow](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-flow)), which is probably what you want to do in most cases, it's recommended to use the [grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid) property instead of `grid-template`.

### column-gap, row-gap, grid-column-gap, and grid-row-gap
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

Specifies the size of the grid lines. You can think of it like setting the width of the gutters between the columns / rows.

Values:

* `{line-size}` - a length value

```css
.container {
  /* standard */
  column-gap: {line-size};
  row-gap: {line-size};

  /* old */
  grid-column-gap: {line-size};
  grid-row-gap: {line-size};
}
```

Example:

```css
.container {
  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px 50px;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 50px 50px;
  column-gap: 10px;
  row-gap: 15px;
}
```

[![grid-gaps](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dddgrid-gap.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dddgrid-gap.svg)

The gutters are only created *between* the columns / rows, not on the outer edges.

> **Note**: The `grid-` prefix will be removed and `grid-column-gap` and `grid-row-gap` renamed to `column-gap` and `row-gap`. The unprefixed properties are already supported.

### gap and grid-gap
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

A shorthand for [row-gap](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row-gap) and [column-gap](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row-gap).

Values:

* `{grid-row-gap}` `{grid-column-gap}` - length values

```css
.container {
  /* standard */
  gap: {grid-row-gap} {grid-column-gap};
  
  /* old */
  grid-gap: {grid-row-gap} {grid-column-gap};
}
```

Example:

```css
.container {
  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px 50px;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 50px 50px;
  gap: 15px 10px;
}
```

If no [column-gap](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row-gap) is specified, it's set to the same value as [row-gap](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row-gap).

> **Note**: The `grid-` prefix will be removed and `grid-gap` renamed to `gap`. The unprefixed property is already supported.

### justify-items
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

Aligns grid items along the *inline (row)* axis (as opposed to [align-items](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-align-items) which aligns along the *block (column)* axis). This value applies to all grid items inside the container.

Values:

* **start** - aligns items to be flush with the start edge of their cell
* **end** - aligns items to be flush with the end edge of their cell
* **center** - aligns items in the center of their cell
* **stretch** - fills the whole width of the cell (this is the default)

```css
.container {
  justify-items: start | end | center | stretch;
}
```

Examples:

```css
.container {
  justify-items: start;
}
```

[![justify-start](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/justify-items-start.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/justify-items-start.svg)

```css
.container {
  justify-items: end;
}
```

[![justify-end](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/justify-items-end.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/justify-items-end.svg)

```css
.container {
  justify-items: center;
}
```

[![justify-center](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/justify-items-center.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/justify-items-center.svg)

```css
.container {
  justify-items: stretch;
}
```

[![justify-stretch](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/justify-items-stretch.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/justify-items-stretch.svg)

This behavior can also be set on individual grid items via the [justify-self](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-justify-self) property.

### align-items
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

Aligns grid items along the *block (column)* axis (as opposed to [justify-items](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-justify-items) which aligns along the *inline (row)* axis). This value applies to all grid items inside the container.

Values:

* **start** - aligns items to be flush with the start edge of their cell

* **end** - aligns items to be flush with the end edge of their cell

* **center** - aligns items in the center of their cell

* **stretch** - fills the whole height of the cell (this is the default)

```css
.container {
  align-items: start | end | center | stretch;
}
```

Examples:

```css
.container {
  align-items: start;
}
```

[![align-start](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/align-items-start.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/align-items-start.svg)

```css
.container {
  align-items: end;
}
```

[![align-end](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/align-items-end.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/align-items-end.svg)

```css
.container {
  align-items: center;
}
```

[![align-center](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/align-items-center.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/align-items-center.svg)

```css
.container {
  align-items: stretch;
}
```

[![align-stretch](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/align-items-stretch.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/align-items-stretch.svg)

This behavior can also be set on individual grid items via the [align-self](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-align-self) property.

### place-items
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

`place-items` sets both the `align-items` and `justify-items` properties in a single declaration.

Values:

* `{align-items}` / `{justify-items}` - the first value sets `align-items`, the second value `justify-items`.
  * If the second value is omitted, the first value is assigned to both properties.

All major browsers support the `place-items` shorthand property.

For more details, see [align-items](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-align-items) and [justify-items](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-justify-items).

### justify-content
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

Sometimes the total size of your grid might be less than the size of its grid container. This could happen if all of your grid items are sized with non-flexible units like `px`. In this case you can set the alignment of hte grid within the grid container. This property aligns the grid along the *inline (row)* axis (as opposed to [align-content]() which aligns the grid along the *block (column)* axis).

Values:

* **start** - aligns the grid to be flush with the start edge of the grid container

* **end** - aligns the grid to be flush with the end edge of the grid container

* **center** - aligns the grid in the center of the grid container

* **stretch** - resizes the grid items to allow the gird to fill the full width of the grid container

* **space-around** - places an even amount of space between each grid item, wiht half-sized spaces on the far ends

* **space-between** - places an even amount of space between each grid item, with no space at the far ends

* **space-evenly** - places an even amount of space between each grid item, including the far ends

```css
.container {
  justify-content: start | end | center | stretch | space-around | space-between | space-evenly;
}
```

Examples:

```css
.container {
  justify-content: start;
}
```

[![justify-start](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/justify-content-start.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/justify-content-start.svg)

### align-content
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

Sometimes the total size of your grid might be less than the size of its grid container. This could happen if all of your grid items are sized with non-flexible units like `px`. In this case, you can set the alignment of the grid within the grid container. This property aligns the grid along the *block (column)* axis (as opposed to [justify-content](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-justify-content) which aligns the grid along the *inline (row)* axis).

Values:

* **start** - aligns the grid to be flush with the start edge of the grid container

* **end** - aligns the grid to be flush with the end edge of the grid container

* **center** - aligns the grid in the center of the grid container

* **stretch** - resizes the grid items to allow the grid to fill the full height of the grid container

* **space-around** - places an even amount of space between each grid item, with half-sized spaces on the far ends

* **space-between** - places an even amount of space between each grid item, with no space at the far ends

* **space-evenly** - places an even amount of space between each grid item, including the far ends

```css
.container {
  align-content: start | end | center | stretch | space-around | space-between | space-evenly;
}
```

Examples:

```css
.container {
  align-content: start;
}
```

### place-content
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

`place-content` sets both the `align-content` and `justify-content` properties in a single declaration.

Values:

* `{align-content}` / `{justify-content}` - the first value sets `align-content`, teh second value `justify-content`.
  * If the second value is omitted, the first value is assigned to both properties.

All major browsers support the `place-content` shorthand property.

For more details, see [align-content](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-align-content) and [justify-content](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-justify-content).

### grid-auto-columns and grid-auto-rows
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

Specifies the size of any auto-generated grid tracks (aka *implicit grid tracks*). Implicit tracks get created when there are more grid items than cells in the grid or when a grid item is placed outside of the explicit grid. (see [The Difference Between Explicit and Implicit Grids](https://css-tricks.com/difference-explicit-implicit-grids/)).

Values:

* `{track-size}` - can be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space in the grid (using the [fr](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#fr-unit) unit)

```css
.container {
  grid-auto-columns: {track-size} ...;
  grid-auto-rows: {track-size} ...;
}
```

To illustrate how implicit grid tracks get created, think about this:

```css
.container {
  grid-template-columns: 60px 60px;
  grid-template-rows: 90px 90px;
}
```

[![grid](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-columns-rows-01.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-columns-rows-01.svg)

This creates a **2 x 2** grid.

But now imagine you use [grid-column]() and [grid-row]() to position your grid items like this:

```css
.item-a {
  grid-column: 1 / 2;
  grid-row: 2 / 3;
}

.item-b {
  grid-column: 5 / 6;
  grid-row: 2 / 3;
}
```

[![grid-layout](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-columns-rows-02.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-columns-rows-02.svg)

We told `.item-b` to start on column 5 and end at column line 6, *but we never defined a column line 5 or 6*. Because we referenced lines that don't exist, implicit tracks with width of 0 are created to fill in the gaps. We can use [grid-auto-columns]() and [grid-auto-rows]() to specify the widths of these implicit tracks:

```css
.container {
  grid-auto-columns: 60px;
}
```

[![auto-columns](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-columns-rows-03.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-columns-rows-03.svg)

### grid-auto-flow
[Back to Top](#css-grid)

If you have grid items that you don't explicitly place on the grid, the *auto-placement algorithm* kicks in to automatically place the items. This property controls how the auto-placement algorithm works.

Values:

* **row** - tells the auto-placement algorithm to fill in each row in turn, adding new rows as necessary (default)

* **column** - tells the auto-placement algorithm to fill in each column in turn, adding new columns as necessary

* **dense** - tells the auto-placement algorithm to attempt to fill in holes earlier in the grid if smaller items come up later

```css
.container {
  grid-auto-flow: row | column | row dense | column dense;
}
```

Note that **dense** only changes the visual order of your items and might cause them to appear out of order, which is bad for accessibility.

Examples:

Consider this HTML:

```html
<section class="container">
  <div class="item-a">item-a</div>
  <div class="item-b">item-b</div>
  <div class="item-c">item-c</div>
  <div class="item-d">item-d</div>
  <div class="item-e">item-e</div>
</section>
```

You define a grid with five columns and two rows, and set `grid-auto-flow` to `row` (which is also the default):

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 60px 60px 60px 60px 60px;
  grid-template-rows: 30px 30px;
  grid-auto-flow: row;
}
```

When placing the items on the grid, you only specify spots for two of them:

```css
.item-a {
  grid-column: 1;
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}

.item-e {
  grid-column: 5;
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}
```

Because we set `grid-auto-flow` to `row`, our grid will look like this. Notice how the three items we didn't place (**item-b**, **item-c**, and **item-d**) flow across the available rows:

[![grid-auto-flow-row](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-flow-01.svg)](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-flow-01.svg)

If we instead set `grid-auto-flow` to `column`, **item-b**, **item-c**, and **item-d** flow down the columns:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 60px 60px 60px 60px 60px;
  grid-template-rows: 30px 30px;
  grid-auto-flow: column;
}
```
