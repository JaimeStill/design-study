## Styling Backgrounds in CSS
[Back to Top](#backgrounds-and-borders)

The CSS [background](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) property is a shorthand for a number of background longhand properties. If you discover a complex background property in a stylesheet, it might seem a little hard to understand as so many values can be paseed in at once.

```css
.box {
  background: linear-gradient(105deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, .2) 39%, rgba(51, 56, 57, 1) 96%) center center / 400px 200px url(big-star.png) center no-repeat, rebeccapurple;
}
```

### Background Colors
[Back to Top](#backgrounds-and-borders)

The [background-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) property defines the background color on any element in CSS. The property accents any valid [color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value). A `background-color` extends underneath the content and padding box of the element.

```css
.box {
  background-color: #567895;
}

h2 {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}

span {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, .5);
}
```

```html
<div class="box">
  <h2>Background Colors</h2>
  <p>Try changing the background <span>colors</span>.</p>
</div>
```

[![background-color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84050014-2c729600-a97b-11ea-9617-0ce3efc56421.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84050014-2c729600-a97b-11ea-9617-0ce3efc56421.png)

### Background Images
[Back to Top](#backgrounds-and-borders)

The [background-image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image) property enables the display of an image in the background of an element. In the example below we have two boxes - one has a background image which is larger than the box, the other has a small image of a star.

By default, the large image is not scaled to fit the box, so we only see a small corner of it, wheras the small image is tiled to fill the box. In this case, the actual image is just a single star.

```css
.a {
  background-image: url(baloons.jpg);
}

.b {
  background-image: url(star.png);
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="box a"></div>
  <div class="box b"></div>
</div>
```

[![background-image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84050357-99862b80-a97b-11ea-8750-e5e4004d79f9.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84050357-99862b80-a97b-11ea-8750-e5e4004d79f9.png)

> If you specify a background color in addition to a background image then the image displays on top of the color.

#### Controlling background-repeat
[Back to Top](#backgrounds-and-borders)

The [background-repeat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-repeat) property is used to control the tiling behavior of images. The available values are:

* `no-repeat` - stop the background from repeating altogether.
* `repeat-x` - repeat horizontally.
* `repeat-y` - repeat vertically.
* `repeat` - the default; repeat in both directions.

#### Sizing the Background Image
[Back to Top](#backgrounds-and-borders)

The [background-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size) property, which can take [length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) and [percentage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/percentage) values, can be used to size an image to fit inside the background of an element.

You can also use keywords:

* `cover` - the browser will make the image just large enough so that it completely covers the box area while still retaining its aspect ratio. In this case some of the image is likely to end up outside the box.
* `contain` - the browser will make the image the right size to fit inside the box. In this case you may end up with gaps on either side or on the top and bottom of the image, if the aspect ratio of the image is different to that of the box.

#### Positioning the Background Image
[Back to Top](#backgrounds-and-borders)

The [background-position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) property allows you to choose the position in which the background image appears on the box it is applied to. This uses a coordinate system in which the top-left-hand corner of the box is `(0,0)`, and the box is positioned along the horizontal (`x`) and vertical (`y`) axes.

> **Note**: The default `background-position` value is `(0,0)`.

The most common `background-position` values take two individual values - a horizontal value followed by a vertical value.

You can use keywords such as `top` and `right` (look up the others on the [background-position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) page):

```css
.box {
  background-image: url(star.png);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: top center;
}
```

[Lengths](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) and [percentages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/percentage):

```css
.box {
  background-image: url(star.png);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: 20px 10%;
}
```

You can also mix keyword values with lengths or percentages:

```css
.box {
  background-image: url(star.png);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: top 20px;
}
```

You can also use a 4-value syntax in order to indicate a distance from certain edges of the box - the length unit in this case is an offset from the value that precedes it. So in the CSS below we are positioning the background 20px from the top and 10px from the right:

```css
.box {
  background-image: url(star.png);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: top 20px right 10px;
}
```

> **Note**: `background-position` is a shorthand for [background-position-x](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position-x) and [background-position-y](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position-y), which allow you to set the different axis position values individually.

### Gradient Backgrounds
[Back to Top](#backgrounds-and-borders)

A gradient - when used for a background - acts just like an image and is also set byu using the [background-image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image) property.

You can read more about the different types of gradients and things you can do with them on the MDN page for the [gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient) data type. A fun way to play with gradients is to use one of the many CSS Gradient Generators available on the web, such as [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/). You can create a gradient then copy and paste the source code that generates it.

```css
.a {
  background-image: linear-gradient(45deg, rgba(0,119,255,1) 0%, rgba(100,0,255,1) 35%, rgba(210,0,0,1) 100%);
}

.b {
  background-image: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(0,119,255,1) 0%, rgba(100,0,255,1) 35%, rgba(210,0,0,1) 100%);
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="box a">
  <div class="box b">
</div>
```

[![gradient-backgrounds](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84053333-c1778e00-a97f-11ea-86c4-093e4792e1e1.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84053333-c1778e00-a97f-11ea-86c4-093e4792e1e1.png)

> **Note**: If you specify a `background-size` smaller than the containing element, the gradient will repeat.

### Multiple Background Images
[Back to Top](#backgrounds-and-borders)

It is also possible to have multilpe background images - you specify multiple `background-image` values in a single property value, separating each one with a comma.

When you do this you may end up with background images overlapping each other. The backgrounds will layer with the last listed background image at the bottom of the stack, and each previous image stacking on top of the one that follows it in the code.

> **Note**: Gradients can be happily mixed with regular background images.

The other `background-*` properties can also have comma-separated values in the same way as `background-image`:

```css
.box {
  background-image: url(image1.png), url(image2.png), url(image3.png), url(image1.png);
  background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat-x, repeat;
  background-position: 10px 20px, top right;
}
```

Each value of hte different properties will match up to the values in the same position in the other properties. Above, for example, `image1`'s `background-repeat` value will be `no-repeat`. However, what happens when different properties have different values? The answer is that the smaller numbers of values will cycle - in the above example there are four background images but only two `background-position` values. The first two position values will be applied to the first two images, then they will cycle back around again - `image3` will be given the first position value, and `image4` will be given the second position value.

### Background Attachment
[Back to Top](#backgrounds-and-borders)

The [background-attachment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-attachment) property specifies how backgrounds scroll when the content scrolls. It can have the following values:

* `scroll`: Causes the element's background to scroll when the page is scrolled. If the element content is scrolled, the background does not move. In effect, the background is fixed to the same position on the page, so it scrolls as the page scrolls.
* `fixed`: Causes an element's background to be fixed to the viewport, so that it doesn't scroll when the page or element content is scrolled. It will always remain in the same position on the screen.
* `local`: This value was added later on because the `scroll` value is rather confusing and doesn't really do what you want in many cases. The `local` value fixes the background to the element it is set on, so when you scroll the element, the background scrolls with it.

The [background-attachment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-attachment) property only has an effect when there is content to scroll. Have a look at [background-attachment.html](http://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/styling-boxes/backgrounds/background-attachment.html) (also [see the source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/master/css/styling-boxes/backgrounds)).

### Using the Background Shorthand Property
[Back to Top](#backgrounds-and-borders)

You will often see backgroudns specified using the [background]() property. This shorthand lets you set all of the different properties at once.

If using multiple backgrounds, you need to specify all of the proeprties for the first background, then add your next background after a comma. In the example below, we have a gradient with a size and position, then an image background with `no-repeat` and a position, then a color.

There are a few rules that need to be followed when writing background image shorthand values, for example:

* A `background-color` may only be specified after the final comma.
* The value for `background-size` may only be included immediately after `background-position`, separated by the '/' character, like this: `center/80%`.

```css
.box {
  background:
    linear-gradient(105deg, rgba(255,255,255,.2) 39%, rgba(51,56,57,1) 96%) center center / 400px 200px no-repeat,
    url(big-star.png) center no-repeat,
    rebeccapurple;
}
```

```html
<div class="box"></div>
```

[![background](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84062702-bcb9d680-a98d-11ea-8fd2-29897aef3aec.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84062702-bcb9d680-a98d-11ea-8fd2-29897aef3aec.png)

## Borders
[Back to Top](#backgrounds-and-borders)

Typically when we add borders to an element with CSS we use a shorthand proeprty that sets the color, width, and style of the border in one line of CSS.

We can set a border for all four sides of a box with [border](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border):

```css
.box {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

Or we can target one edge of the box, for example:

```css
.box {
  border-top: 1px solid black;
}
```

The individual properties for these shorthands would be:

```css
.box {
  border-width: 1px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: black;
}
```

And for the longhands:

```css
.box {
  border-top-width: 1px;
  border-top-style: solid;
  border-top-color: black;
}
```

> **Note**: These top, right, bottom, and left border properties have mapped *logical* properties which relate to the writing mode of the document (e.g. left-to-right, right-to-left, or top-to-bottom).

```css
.box {
  background-color: #567895;
  border: 5px solid #0b385f;
  border-bottom-style: dashed;
  color: #fff;
}

h2 {
  border-top: 2px dotted rebeccapurple;
  border-bottom: 1em double rgb(24, 163, 78);
}
```

```html
<div class="box">
  <h2>Borders</h2>
  <p>Try changing the borders.</p>
</div>
```

[![borders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84063259-c98afa00-a98e-11ea-8e95-e0a6d19ffd70.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/84063259-c98afa00-a98e-11ea-8e95-e0a6d19ffd70.png)

### Rounded Corners
[Back to Top](#backgrounds-and-borders)

Rounding corners on a box is achieved by using the [border-radius](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius) property and associated longhands which relate to each corner of the box. Two lengths or percentages may be used as a value, the first value defining the horizontal radius, and the second the vertical radius. In a lot of cases you will only pass one value, which will be used for both.

For example, to make all four corners of a box have a 10px radius:

```css
.box {
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

Or to make the top right corner have a horizontal radius of 1em, and a vertical radius of 10%:

```css
.box {
  border-top-right-radius: 1em 10%;
}
```

In this example, all four corners have been set, and the value for the top right corner has been changed to make it different.

```css
.box {
  border: 10px solid rebeccapurple;
  border-radius: 1em;
  border-top-right-radius: 10% 30%;
}
```

```html
<div class="box">
  <h2>Borders</h2>
  <p>Try changing the borders.</p>
</div>
```
