Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items.

## Block and Inline Boxes
[Back to Top](#the-box-model)

CSS broadly has two types of boxes - **block boxes** and **inline boxes**. These characteristics refer to how the box behaves in terms of page flow, and in relation to other boxes on the page:

If a box is defined as a block, it will behave in the following ways:

* The box will break onto a new line.
* The box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container. In most cases this means that the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available.
* The `width` and `height` properties are respected.
* Padding, margin, and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box.

Unless we decide to change the display type to inline, elements such as heading (e.g. `<h1>`) and `<p>` all use `block` as their outer display type by default.

If a box has an outer display type of `inline`, then:

* The box will not break onto a new line.
* The `width` and `height` properties will not apply.
* Vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.
* Horizontal padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.

The `<a>` element, used for links, `<span>`, `<em>`, and `<strong>` are all examples of elements that will display inline by default.

THe type of box applied to an element is defined by [display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) property values such as `block` and `inline`, and relates to the **outer** value of `display`.

## Inner and Outer Display Types
[Back to Top](#the-box-model)

Boxes in CSS have an *outer* display type, which details whether the box is block or inline.

Boxes also have an *inner* display type, however, which dictates how elements inside that box are laid out. By default, the elements inside a box are laid out in [normal flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow), which means that they behave just like any other block and inline elements (as explained above).

We can, however, change the inner display type by using `display` values like `flex`. If we set `display: flex;` on an element, the outer display type is `block`, but the inner display type is changed to `flex`. Any direct children of this box will become flex items and will be laid out according to the rules set out in the [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) spec.

## What Is the CSS Box Model?
[Back to Top](#the-box-model)

The full CSS box model applies to block boxes, inline boxes only use some of the behavior defined in the box model. The model defines how the different parts of a box - margin, border, padding, and content - work together to create a box that you can see on the page. To add some additional complexity, there is a standard and an alternate box model.

### Parts of a Box
[Back to Top](#the-box-model)

Making up a block box in CSS we hav ethe:

* **Content box**: The area where your content is displayed, which can be sized using properties like [width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) and [height](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height).
* **Padding box**: The padding sits around the content as white space; its size can be controlled using [padding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding) and related properties.
* **Border box**: The border box wraps the content and any padding. Its size and style can be controlled using [border](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) and related properties.
* **Margin box**: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the contnet, padding and border as whitespace between this box and other elements. Its size can be controlled using [margin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) and related properties.

The below diagram shows these layers:

[![box-model](https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2019/03/19/16558/29c6fe062e42a327fb549a081bc56632/box-model.png)](https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2019/03/19/16558/29c6fe062e42a327fb549a081bc56632/box-model.png)

### The Standard CSS Box Model
[Back to Top](#the-box-model)

In the standard box model, if you give a box a `width` and a `height` attribute, this defines the width and height of the *content box*. Any padding and border is then added to that width and height to get the total size taken up by the box. This is shown in the image below.

If we assume that the box has the following CSS defining `width`, `height`, `margin`, `border`, and `padding`:

```css
.box {
  width: 350px;
  height: 150px;
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 25px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}
```

The space taken up by our box using the standard box model will actually be 410px (350 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5), and the height 210px (150 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5), as the padding and border are added to the width and used for the content box.

[![standard-box-model](https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2019/03/19/16559/d7dbf772b414a2c96d8ac362c15ed352/standard-box-model.png)](https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2019/03/19/16559/d7dbf772b414a2c96d8ac362c15ed352/standard-box-model.png)

> **Note**: The margin is not counted towards the actual size of the box - sure, it affects the total space that the box will take up on the page, but only the space outside the box. The box's area stops at the border - it does not extend into the margin.

### The Alternate CSS Box Model
[Back to Top](#the-box-model)

You might think it is rather inconvenient to have to add up the border and padding to get the real size of the box, and you would be right! For this reason, CSS has had an alternate box model introduced some time after the standard box model. Using this model, any width is the width of the visible box on the page, therefore the content area width is that width minus the width for the padding and border. The same CSS as used above would give the below result (width = 350px, height = 150px).

[![alternate-box-model](https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2019/03/19/16557/3e3f8c74c68f5c1fdc6779d7388bc099/alternate-box-model.png)](https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2019/03/19/16557/3e3f8c74c68f5c1fdc6779d7388bc099/alternate-box-model.png)

By default, browsers use the standard box model. If you want to turn on the alternate model for an element you do so by setting `box-sizing: border-box` on it. By doing this you are telling the browser to take the border box as the area defined by any size you set.

```css
.box {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

If you want all of your elements to use the alternate box model, and this is a common choice among developers, set the `box-sizing` property on the `<html>` element, then set all other elements ot inherit that value, as seen in the snippet below. If you want to understand the thinking behind this, see [the CSS Tricks article on box-sizing](https://css-tricks.com/inheriting-box-sizing-probably-slightly-better-best-practice/).

```css
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

*, *::before, *::after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

> **Note**: An interesting bit of history - Internet Explorer used to default to the alternate box model, with no mechanism available to switch.

## Margins, Padding, and Borders
[Back to Top](#the-box-model)

The `margin`, `padding`, and `border` properties are **shorthands** that allow us to set all four sides of the box at once. These shorthands also have equivalent longhand properties, which allow control over the different sides of the box individually.

### Margin
[Back to Top](#the-box-model)

The margin is an invisible space around your box. It pushes other elements away from the box. Margins can have positive and negative values. Setting a negative margin on one side of your box can cause it to overlap other things on the page. Whether you are using the standard or alternate box model, the margin is always added after the size of the visible box has been calculated.

All margins of an element can be controlled at once using the [margin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) property, or each side individually using the equivalent longhand properties:

* [margin-top](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-top)
* [margin-right](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-right)
* [margin-bottom](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-bottom)
* [margin-left](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-left)

#### Margin Collapsing
[Back to Top](#the-box-model)

A key thing to understand about margins is the concept of margin collapsing. If you have two elements whose margins touch, and both margins are positive, those margins will combine to become one margin, which is the size of hte largest individual margin. If yone or both margins are negative, the amount of negative value will subtract from the total.

In the example below, we have two paragraphs. The top paragraph has a `margin-bottom` of 50 pixels. The second paragraph has a `margin-top` of 30 pixels. The margins have collapsed together so the actual margin between the boxes is 50 pixels and not the total of the two margins.

```css
.one {
  margin-bottom: 50px;
}

.two {
  margin-top: 10px;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <p class="one">I am paragraph one.</p>
  <p class="two">I am paragraph two.</p>
</div>
```

There are a number of rules that dictate when margins do and do not collapse. For further information see the detailed page on [mastering margin collapsing](). The main thing to remember for now is that margin collapsing is a thing that happens. If you are creating space with margins and don't get the space you expect, this is probably what is happening.

### Border
[Back to Top](#the-box-model)

The border is drawn between the margin and the padding of a box. If you are using the standard box model, the size of the border is added to the `width` and `height` of the box. If you are using the alternate box model then the size of the border makes the content box smaller as it takes up some of that available `width` and `height`.

For styling borders, there are a large number of properties - there are four borders, each border has a style, width, and color that we might want to manipulate.

You can set the width, style, and color of all four borders at once using the [border](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) property.

To sset the properties of each side individually, you can use:

* [border-top](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-top)
* [border-right](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-right)
* [border-bottom](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-bottom)
* [border-left](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-left)

To set the width, style, or color of all sides, use the following:

* [border-width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-width)
* [border-style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-style)
* [border-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-color)

To set the width, style, or color of a single side, you can use one of the most granular longhand properties:

* [border-top-width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-top-width)
* [border-top-style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-top-style)
* [border-top-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-top-color)
* [border-right-width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-right-width)
* [border-right-style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-right-style)
* [border-right-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-right-color)
* [border-bottom-width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-bottom-width)
* [border-bottom-style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-bottom-style)
* [border-bottom-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-bottom-color)
* [border-left-width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-left-width)
* [border-left-style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-left-style)
* [border-left-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-left-color)

### Padding
[Back to Top](#the-box-model)

The padding sits between the border and the content area. Unlike margins you cannot have negative amounts of padding, so the value must be 0 or a positive value. Any background applied to your element will display behind the padding, and it is typically used to push the content away from the border.

The padding on each side of an element can be controlled using the [padding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding) property, or individually using the equivalent longhand properties:

* [padding-top](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding-top)
* [padding-right](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding-right)
* [padding-bottom](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding-bottom)
* [padding-left](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding-left)

## The Box Model and Inline Boxes
[Back to Top](#the-box-model)

All of hte above applies fully to block boxes. Some of the properties can apply to inline boxes too, such as those created by a `<span>` element.

In the example below, we have a `<span>` inside a paragraph and have applied a `width`, `height`, `margin`, `border`, and `padding` to it. You can see that the width and height are ignored. The vertical margin, padding, and border are respected but they do not change the relationship of other content to our inline box and so the padding and border overlaps other words in the paragraph. Horizontal padding, margins, and borders are respected and will cause other content to move away from the box.

```css
span {
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 80px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  border: 2px solid blue;
}
```

```html
<p>
  I am a paragraph and this is a <span>span</span> inside that paragraph. A span is an inline element and so does not respect width and height.
</p>
```

## Using display: inline-block
[Back to Top](#the-box-model)

There is a special value of `display`, which provides a middle ground between `inline` and `block`. This is useful for situations where you do not want an item to break onto a new line, but do want it to respect `width` and `height` and avoid the overlapping seen above.

An element with `display: inline-block` does a subste of the block things we already know about:

* The `width` and `height` properties are respected.
* `padding`, `margin`, and `border` will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box.

It does not, however, break onto a new line, and will only become larger than its content if you explicitly add `width` and `height` properties.

```css
span {
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 80px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  border: 2px solid blue;
  display: inline-block;
}
```

```html
<p>
  I am a paragraph and this is a <span>span</span> inside that paragraph. A span is an inline element and so does not respect width and height.
</p>
```
