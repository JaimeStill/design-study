## Horizontally
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

### Inline Horizontal
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

You can center inline elements horizontally, within a block-level parent element, with the `text-align` property:

```css
.center-children {
  text-align: center;
}
```

> This will work for `inline`, `inline-block`, `inline-table`, `inline-flex`, etc.

### One Block Horizontal
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

You can center a block-level element by giving it `margin-left` and `margin-right` of `auto` (and it has a set `width`, otherwise it would be full width and wouldn't need centering). That's often done shorthand like this:

```css
.center-me {
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

This will work no matter what the width of the block level element you're centering, or the parent.

> You can't `float` an element to the center.

### Multiple Blocks Horizontal
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

If you have two or more block-level elements that need to be centered horizontally *in a row*, chances are you'd be better served making them a different `display` type.

Here's an example of making them `inline-block`:

```html
<main class="inline-block-center">
  <!-- multiple div elements -->
</main>
```

```css
.inline-block-center {
  text-align: center;
}

.inline-block-center div {
  display: inline-block;
  text-align: left;
}
```

Here's an example of flexbox:

```html
<main class="flex-center">
  <!-- multiple div elements -->
</main>
```

```css
.flex-center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

## Vertically

### Inline Vertical
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

#### Single Line
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

Sometimes inline / text elements can appear vertically centered, just because there is equal padding above and below them.

```css
.link {
  padding-top: 30px;
  padding-bottom: 30px;
}
```

If padding isn't an option for some reason, and you're trying to center some text that you know will not wrap, there is a trick where making the `line-height` equal to the height will `center` the text:

```css
.center-text-trick {
  height: 100px;
  line-height: 100px;
  white-space: nowrap;
}
```

#### Multiple Lines
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

E#qual padding on top and bottom can give the cnetered effect for multiple lines of text too, but if that isn't going to work, perhaps the leemnet text is in can be a table cell, either literally or made to behave like one with CSS. The [vertical-align]() property handles this, in this case, unlike what it normally does which is handle the alignment of elements aligned on a row. ([More on that.](https://css-tricks.com/what-is-vertical-align/))

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      I'm vertically centered multiple lines of text in a real table cell.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div class="center-table">
  <p>
    I'm vertically centered multiple lines of text in a CSS-created table layout.
  </p>
</div>
```

```css
table {
  background: white;
  width: 240px;
  border-collapse: separate;
  margin: 20px;
  height: 250px;
}

table td {
  background: black;
  color: white;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 10px solid white;
  /* default is vertical-align: middle; */
}

.center-table {
  display: table;
  height: 250px;
  background: white;
  width: 240px;
  margin: 20px;
}

.center-table p {
  display: table-cell;
  margin: 0;
  background: black;
  color: white;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 10px solid white;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

If table is not preferreable, you can use flexbox. A single flex-child can be made to cneter in a flex-parent easily:

```css
.flex-center-vertically {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 400px;
}
```

Remember that it's only really relevant if the parent container has a fixed height (px, %, etc), which is why the container here has a height.

### Block Vertical
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

#### Known Height
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

It's fairly common to *not* know the height in web page layout, for lots of reasons: if the width changes, text reflow can change the height. Variance in the styling of text can change the height. Variance in the amount of text can change the height. Elements with a fixed aspect ratio, like images, can change height when resized. Etc.

But if you do know the height, you can center vertically like:

```css
.parent {
  position: relative;
}

.child {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  height: 100px;
  margin-top: -50px;
}
```

#### Unknown Height
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

It's still possible to center it by nudging it up half of it's hight after bumping it down halfway:

```css
.parent {
  position: relative;
}

.child {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
}
```

#### Element Stretches Height
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

If you don't care about the element stretching the height of the container, and you just need the content inside vertically centered, using tables or CSS display to make elements into tables can do the trick.

```html
<main>
  <div>
    I'm a block-level element with an unknown height, centered vertically within my parent.
  </div>
</main>
```

```css
main {
  background: white;
  height: 300px;
  margin: 20px;
  width: 300px;
  position: relative;
  padding: 20px;
  display: table;
}

main div {
  background: black;
  color: white;
  padding: 20px;
  display: table-cell;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

#### Via Flexbox
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

It's really easy via flexbox:

```css
.parent {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

## Horizontally and Vertically
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

### Fixed Width and Height
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

Using negative margins equal to half of that width and height, after you've absolutely positioned it at 50% / 50% will center it with great cross browser support:

```css
.parent {
  position: relative;
}

.child {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 20px;

  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;

  margin: -70px 0 0 -170px;
}
```

### Unknown Width and Height
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

If you don't know the width or height, you can use the transform property and a negative translate of 50% in both directions (it is based on the current width / height of the element) to center:

```css
.parent {
  position: relative;
}

.child {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Flexbox
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

To center in both directions via flexbox:

```css
.parent {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Grid
[Back to Top](#centering-in-css)

A little trick that will pretty much work for one element:
 
```html
<div class="center-me">
  I'm centered!
</div>
```

```css
body, html {
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
}

.center-me {
  margin: auto;
}
```
