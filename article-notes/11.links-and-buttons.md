There is a lot to know about links and buttons in HTML. THere is markup implementation and related attributes, styleing best practices, things to avoid, and even-more-nuanced cousins of the link: buttons and button-like inputs.

> Quick **guidelines** on when to use each:
> * Are you giving a user a way to go to another page or a different part of the same page? Use a **link** (`<a href="/somewhere">link</a>`)
> * Are you making a JavaScript-powered clickable action? Use a **button** (`<button type="button">button</button>`)
> * Are you submitting a form? Use a **submit input** (`<input type="submit" value="Submit">`)

## Links
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Links are one of the most basic, yet deeply fundamental and foundational building blocks of the web. Click a link, and you move to another page or are moved to another place within the same page.

### Link HTML
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

#### Basic Links
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

```html
<a href="https://css-tricks.com">CSS Tricks</a>
```

A link to a "fully qualitifed" or "absolute" URL.

#### Relative Links
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

```html
<a href="/pages/about.html">About</a>
```

Relative URLs are most useful for things like navigation, but be careful of suing them within content - like blog posts - where that content may be read off-site, like in an app or RSS feed.

#### Jump Links
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Links can also be "hash links" or "jump links" by starting with a `#`:

```html
<a href="#section-2">Section Two</a>
<section id="section-2"></section>
```

Clicking that link will "jump" (scroll) to the first element in the DOM with an ID that matches, like the section element above.

> **Trick**: Using a hash link (e.g. `#0`) in development can be useful so you can click the link without being sent back to the top of the page like a click on a `#` link does. But careful, links that don't link anywhere should never make it to production.

> **Trick**: Jump-links can sometimes benefit from [smooth scrolling](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/) to help people understand that the page is moving from one place to another.

It's a fairly common UI/UX thing to see a "Back to top" link on sites, particularly where important navigational controls are at the top but there is quite a bit of content to scroll (or otherwise navigate) through. To create a jump link, link to the ID of an element that is at the top of the page where it makes sense to send focus back to.

```html
<a href="#top-of-page">Back to Top</a>
```

Jump links are sometimes also used to link to other anchor (`<a>`) elements that have no `href` attribute. Thos are called "placeholder" links:

```html
<a id="section-2"></a>
<h3>Section 2</h3>
```

There are [accessibility considerations](https://www.scottohara.me/note/2019/07/17/placeholder-link.html) of these, but overall they are acceptable.

#### Disabled Links
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

A link without an `href` is the only [practical way](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-disable-links/) to disable a link. Why disable a link? Perhaps it's a link that only becomes active after logging in or signing up.

```css
a:not[href] {
  /* style a "disabled" link */
}
```

When a link has no `href`, there is no role, no focusability, and no keyboard events. This is intentional. You could think of it like a `<span>`.

#### Open in New Tab
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Do you need to open in a new window or tab? You can use the `target` attribute for that, but it's [strongly discouraged](https://adrianroselli.com/2020/02/link-targets-and-3-2-5.html).

```html
<a href="https://css-tricks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS Tricks</a>
```

The bit that makes it work is `target="_blank"`, but note the extra `rel` attribute and values there which [make it safer](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/) and [faster](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/performance-benefits-of-rel-noopener/).

Making links open in new tabs is a major UX discussion. We have [a whole article about when to use it here](https://css-tricks.com/use-target_blank/). Summarized:

Don't use it:

* Because you or your client prefer it personally.
* Because you're trying to beef up your time on site metric.
* Because you're distinguishing between internal and external links or content types.
* Because it's your way of dealing with infinite scroll trickiness.

Do use it:

* Because a user is doing something on the current page, like actively playing media or has unsaved work.
* You have some obscure technical reason why you are forced to (even then you're stll probably the rule, not the exception).

#### Trigger a Download
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Need the link to trigger a download? [The download attribute](https://css-tricks.com/building-good-download-button/) on a link will instruct the browser to download the linked file rather than opening it within the current page / tab. It's a nice UX touch.

```html
<a href="/files/file.pdf" download>Download PDF</a>
```

#### The rel Attribute
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

This attribute is for the relationship of the link to the target.

The `rel` attribute is also commonly used on the `<link>` element (which is not used for creating hyperlinks, but for things like including CSS and preloading). We're not including `rel` values for the `<link>` element here, just anchor links.

Here are some basic examples:

```html
<a href="/page/3" rel="next">Next</a>
<a href="/page/1" rel="prev">Previous</a>

<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" rel="license">cc by 2.0</a>

<a href="/topics/" rel="directory">All Topics</a>
```

* `rel="alternate"`: alternate version of the document.
* `rel="author"`: author of the document.
* `rel="help"`: a resource for help with the document.
* `rel="license"`: license and legal information.
* `rel="manifest"`: web app manifest document.
* `rel="next"`: next document in the series.
* `rel="prev"`: previous document in the series.
* `rel="search"`: a document meant to perform a search in the current document.

There are some `rel` attributes specifically to [inform search engines](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/96569?hl=en):

* `rel="sponsored"`: mark links that are advertisements or paid placements (commonly called paid links) as sponsored.
* `rel="ugc"`: for not-particularly-trusted user-generated content, like comments and forum posts.
* `rel="nofollow"`: tell the search engine to ignore this and not associate this site with where this links to.

And also some `rel` attributes that are most security-focused:

* `rel="noopener"`: prevent a new tab from using the JavaScript `window.opener` feature, which could potentially access the page containing the link (your site) to perform malicious things, like stealing information or sharing infected code. Using this with `target="_blank"` is [often a good idea](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/performance-benefits-of-rel-noopener/).
* `rel="noreferrer"`: prevent other sites or tracking services (e.g. Google Analytics) from identifying your page as the source of clicked link.

You can use multiple space-separated values if you need to (e.g. `rel="noopener noreferrer"`).

And finally, some `rel` attributes come from [the microformats standard](http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-faq#How_is_rel_used) and the [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/rel-me) like:

* `rel="directory"`: indicates that the destination of the hyperlink is a directory listing containing an entry for the current page.
* `rel="tag"`: indicates that the destination of that hyperlink is an author-designated "tag" (or keyword / subject) for the current page.
* `rel="payment"`: indicates that the destination of that hyperlink provides a way to show or give support for the current page.
* `rel="help"`: states that the resource linked to is a help file or FAQ for the current document.
* `rel="me"`: indicates that its destination represents the same person or entity as the current page.

#### ARIA roles
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

The default role of a link is `link`, so you do *not* need to do:

```html
<a role="link" href="/">Link</a>
```

You'd only need that if you were faking a link, which would be a weird / rare thing to ever need to do, and you'd have to use some JavaScript in addition to this to make it actually follow the link.

```html
<span class="link" tabindex="0" role="link" data-href="/">
  Fake accessible link created using a span
</span>
```

Just looking above you can see how much extra work faking a link is, and that is before you consider that it breaks right-clicking, doesn't allow opening in a new tab, doesn't work with Windows High Contrast Mode and other reader modes and assistive technology. Pretty bad!

A useful ARIA role to [indicate the current]() page, like:

```html
<a href="/" aria-current="page">Home</a>
<a href="/contact">Contact</a>
<a href="/about">About</a>
```


#### Should You Use the title Attribute?
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

[Probably not](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title#Accessibility_concerns). Save this for giving an `iframe` a short, descriptive title.

```html
<a title="I don't need to be here" href="/">
  List of Concerts
</a>
```

`title` provides a hover-triggered UI popup showing the text you wrote. You can't style it, and it's [not really that accessible](https://www.24a11y.com/2017/the-trials-and-tribulations-of-the-title-attribute/).

Hover-triggered is the key phrase here. It's unusuable on any touch-only device. If a link needs more contextual information, provide that in actual content around the link, or use descriptive text for the link itself (as opposed to something like "Click Here").

#### Icon-only Links
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

If a link only has an icon inside it, like:

```html
<a href="/">😲</a>

<a href="/">
  <svg>...</svg>
</a>
```

That isn't enough contextual information about the link, particularly for accessibility reasons, but [potentially for anybody](https://thomasbyttebier.be/blog/the-best-icon-is-a-text-label). Links with text are almost always more clear. If you absolutely can't use text, you can use a pattern like:

```html
<a href="/">
  <svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false">...</svg>
  <span class="visual-hidden">Useful link text</span>
</a>
```

`visually-hidden` is a class used to visually hide the label text with CSS:

```css
.visually-hidden {
  border: 0;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  height: 1px;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 0;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}
```

Unlike `aria-label`, visually hidden text can be translated and will hold up better in [specialized browsing modes](https://css-tricks.com/reader-mode-the-button-to-beat/).

#### Links Around Images
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Images can be links if you wrap them in a link. There is no need to use the alt text to say the image is a link, as assitive technology will do that already.

```html
<a href="/buy/puppies/now">
  <img src="puppy.jpg" alt="A happy puppy.">
</a>
```

#### Links Around Bigger Chunks of Content
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

You can link a whole area of content, like:

```html
<a href="/article/">
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Card</h2>
    <img src="..." alt="...">
    <p>Content</p>
  </div>
</a>
```

But of course, there are UX implications. For example, it can be harder to select the text, and the entire element needs fairly complex styling to create clear focus and hover states. There are also [accessibility implications](https://adrianroselli.com/2020/02/block-links-cards-clickable-regions-etc.html), like the fact that the content of the entire card is read before it is announced as a link.

### Link Styling
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Here's the default look of a link:

[![default-link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85331137-92930900-b4a3-11ea-9844-cf3d448e41ab.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85331137-92930900-b4a3-11ea-9844-cf3d448e41ab.png)

It's likely you'll be changing the style of your links,a nd alos likely you'll use CSS to do it, I could make all my links red in CSS by doing:

```css
a {
  color: red;
}
```

Sometimes selecting and styling *all* links on a page is a bit heavy-handed, as links in navigation might be treated entirely differently than links within text. You can always *scope* selectors to target links within particular areas like:

```css
/* navigation links */
nav a { }

/* links in an article */
article a { }

/* links contained in an element with a "text" class */
.text a { }
```

Or select the link directly to style.

```css
.link {
  /* for styling <a class="link" href="/"> */
}

a[aria-current="page"] {
  /*
    you'll need to apply this attribute yourself, but it's
    a great pattern to use for active navigation.
  */
}
```

#### Link States
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

* `:hover`: for styling when a mouse pointer is over a link.
* `:visited`: for styling when the link has been followed, as best as the browser can remember.
  * it has limited stiling ability due to security.
* `:link`: for styling when a link has *not* been visited.
* `:active`: for styling when the link is pressed (e.g. the mouse button is donw or the element is being tapped on a touch screen).
* `:focus`: very important! Links should always have a focus style. If you choose to remove the default blue outline that most browsers apply, also use this selector to [re-apply a visually obvious focus style](https://css-tricks.com/focusing-on-focus-styles/).

These are chainable like any pseudo-class, so you could do something like this if it is useful for your design / UX:

```css
/* style focus and hover states in a single ruleset */
a:focus:hover { }
```

#### Links as Buttons
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

You can style a link to look button-like. Perhaps some of the confusion between links and buttons is stuff like this:

[![button-link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85332636-4e553800-b4a6-11ea-8936-50db3ff239c6.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85332636-4e553800-b4a6-11ea-8936-50db3ff239c6.png)

*Very cool "button" style from [Katherine Kato](https://codepen.io/kathykato/pen/gOOjgmP)*

That certainly looks like a button! Everyone would call that a button. Even a design system would likely call that a button and perhaps have a class like `.button { }`. But! A think you can click that says "Learn More" is [very much a link, not a button](https://css-tricks.com/css-basics-styling-links-like-boss/). THat's completely fine, it's just yet another reminder to use the semantically and functionally correct element.

#### Color Contrast
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Since we often style links with a distinct color, it's important to use a color with sufficient color contrast for accessibility. There is a wide variety of visual impairments (see the tool [WhoCanUse](https://whocanuse.com/) for simulating color combinations with different impairments) and high contrast helps nearly all of them.

Perhaps you set a blue color for links:

[![blue-link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85332944-ce7b9d80-b4a6-11ea-9d05-ca7d59a22249.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85332944-ce7b9d80-b4a6-11ea-9d05-ca7d59a22249.png)

*The blue link is `#2196f3`*

While that might look OK to you, it's better to use tools for testing to ensure the color has a strong enough ratio according to [researched guidelines](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/accessible-styles#color_and_contrast). Here, I'll look at Chrome DevTools and it will tell me this color is not compliant in that it doesn't have enough contrast with the background color behind it:

[![bad-contrast-ratio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85333260-477af500-b4a7-11ea-8e5a-0bf6dc0f8ff2.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85333260-477af500-b4a7-11ea-8e5a-0bf6dc0f8ff2.png)

*Chrome DevTools is telling us this link color does **not** have enough contrast*.

Color contrast is a big consideration with links, not just because they are often colored in a unique color that needs to be checked, but because they have all those different states(hover, focus, active, visited) which also might have different colors. Compound that with the fact that text can be selected and you've got a lot of placed to consider contrast. [Here's an article about all that](https://css-tricks.com/a-whole-bunch-of-places-to-consider-contrast-in-a-single-paragraph/).

#### Styling Types of Links
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

We can get clever in CSS with attribute selectors and figure out what kind of resource a link is pointing to, assuming the `href` value has useful stuff in it.

```css
/* style all links that include .pdf at the end */
a[href$=".pdf"]::after {
  content: " (PDF)";
}

/* style links that point to Google */
a[href*="google.com"] {
  color: purple;
}
```

#### Styling Links for Print
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

CSS has an ["at-rule"](https://css-tricks.com/the-at-rules-of-css/) for declaring styles that only take effect on printed media (e.g. printing out a web page). You can include them in any CSS like this:

```css
@media print {
  aritcle a::after {
    content: " (" attr(href) ")";
  }
}
```

#### Resetting Styles
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

If you needed to take all the styling off a link (or really any other element for that matter), CSS provides a way to remove all the styles using the `all` property:

```css
.special-area a {
  all: unset;
  all: revert;

  /* start from scratch */
  color: purple;
}
```

You can also remove individual styles with keywords. (Again this isn't really unique to links, but is generically useful):

```css
a {
  /* grab color from nearest parent that sets it */
  color: inherit;

  /* wipe out style (turn black) */
  color: initial;

  /* change back to User Agent style (blue) */
  color: revert;
}
```

### Link JavaScript
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Say you wanted to stop the clicking of a link from doing what it normally does: go to that link or jump around the page. In JavaScript, you can use `preventDefault` to prevent jumping around.

```js
const jumpLinks = document.querySelectorAll("a[href^='#']");

jumpLinks.forEach(link => {
  link.addEventListener('click', event => {
    event.preventDefault();
    // do something else instead, like handle the navigation behavior yourself
  });
});
```

This kind of thing is at the core of how "Single Page Apps" (SPAs) work. They intercept the clicks so browsers don't take over and handle the navigation.

SPAs see where you are trying to go (within your own site), load the data they need, replace what they need to on the page, and update the URL. It's an awful lot of work to replicate what the browser does for free, but you get the ability to do things like animate between pages.

Another JavaScript concern with links is that, when a link to another page is clicked, the page is left and another page loads. That can be problematic for something like a page that contains a form the user is filling out but hasn't completed. If they click the link and leave the page, they lose their work! Your only opportunity to prevent the user from leaving is by using the `beforeunload` event:

```js
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', event => {
  // Remind the user to save their work or whatever.
});
```

A link that has had its default behavior removed won't announce the new destination. This means a person using assistive technology may not know where they wound up. You'll have to do thinkgs like update the page's title and move focus back up to the top of the document.

#### JavaScript Frameworks
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

In a JavaScript framework, like [React](https://css-tricks.com/guides/react/), you might sometimes see links created from something like a `<Link />` component rather than a native `<a>` element. The custom component probably creates a native `<a>` element, but with extra functionality, like enabling the JavaScript router to work, and adding attributes like `aria-current="page"` as needed, which is a good thing!

Ultimately, a link is a link. A JavaScript framework might offer or encourage some level of abstraction, but you're always free to use regular links.

### Link Accessibility
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

We covered some accessibility in the sections above (it's all related!), but here are some more things to think about:

* You don't need text like "Link" or "Go to" in the link text itself. Make the text meaningful ("documentation" instead of "click here").
* Links already have an ARIA role by default (`role="link"`) so there's no need to explicitly set it.
* Try not to use the URL itself as the text(`<a href="google.com">google.com</a>).
* Links are *generally* blue and *generally* underlined and that's [generally good](https://adrianroselli.com/2016/06/on-link-underlines.html).
* All images in content should have `alt` text anyway, but doubly so when the image is wrappe din a link with otherwise no text.

#### Unique Accessible Names
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Some assistive technology can create **lists of interactive elements on the page**. Imagine a group of four article cards that all have a "Read More", the list of interactive elements will be like:

* Read More
* Read More
* Read More
* Read More

Not very useful. You could make use of that `.visually-hidden` calss we covered to make the links more like:

```html
<a href="/article">
  Read More
  <span class="visually-hidden">
    of the article "Dancing with Rabbits".
  </span>
</a>
```

Now each link is unique and clear. If the design can support it, do it *without* the visually hidden class to remove the ambiguity for everyone.

## Buttons
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Buttons are for triggering actions. When do you use the `<button>` element? A **good rule** is to use a button when there is "no meaningful `href`." Here's another way to think of that: if clicking it doesn't do anything without JavaScript, it should be a `<button>`.

A `<button>` that is within a `<form>`, by default, will submit that form. But aside from that, button elements don't have any default behavior, and you'll be wiring up that interactivity with JavaScript.

### Button HTML
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

```html
<button>Buy Now</button>
```

Buttons inside of a `<form>` do something by default: they submit the form. They can also reset it, like their input counterparts. The `type` attributes matter:

```html
<form action="/" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name" id="name">
  <button>Submit</button>

  <!-- if you want to be more explicit... -->
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>

  <!-- or clear the form inputs back to their initial values -->
  <button type="reset">Reset</button>

  <!-- this prevents a `submit` action from firing which may be useful sometimes inside a form -->
  <button type="button">Non-submitting button</button>
</form>
```

Speakin gof forms, buttons have some neat tricks up their sleeve where they can override attributes on the `<form>` itself.

```html
<form action="/" method="get">
  <!-- override the action -->
  <button formaction="/elsewhere/" type="submit">Submit to elsewhere</button>

  <!-- override enctype -->
  <button formenctype="multipart/form-data" type="submit"></button>

  <!-- override method -->
  <button formmethod="post" type="submit"></button>

  <!-- do not validate fields -->
  <button formnovalidate type="submit"></button>

  <!-- override target e.g. open in new tab -->
  <button formtarget="_blank" type="submit"></button>
</form>
```

#### Autofocus
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Since buttons are focusable elements, we can automatically focus on them when the page loads using the `autofocus` attribute:

```html
<div class="modal">
  <h2>Save document?</h2>
  <button>Cancel</button>
  <button autofocus>OK</button>
</div>
```

Perhaps you'd do that inside of a modal dialog where one of the actions is a default action and it helps the UX (e.g. you can press `Enter` to dismiss the modal). Autofocusing *after a user action* is perhaps the only good practice here, moving a user's focus without their permissions, as the `autofocus` attribute is capable of, can be a problem for screen reader and screen magnifier users.

> Note that `autofocus` may not work if the element is within an `<iframe sandbox>` for security reasons.

#### Disabling Buttons
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

To prevent a button from being interactive, there is a `disabled` attribute you can use:

```html
<button disabled>Pay Now</button>
<p class="error-message">Correct the form above to submit payment.</p>
```

Note that we've included descriptive text alongside the disabled button. It can be very frustrating to find a disabled button and not know why it's disabled. A better way to do this could be to let someone submit the form, and then explain why it didn't work in the validation feedback messaging.

Regardless, you could style a disabled button this way:

```css
button[disabled] {
  opacity: 0.5;
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

#### Buttons With Child Elements
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

A submit button and a submit input (`<input type="submit">`) are identical in functionality, but different in the sense that an input is unable to contain child elements while a button can.

```html
<button>
  <svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false">
    <!-- svg details -->
  </svg>
  <span class="callout">Big</span> Sale!
</button>

<button type="button">
  <span role="img" aria-label="Fox">
    🦊
  </span>
  Button
</button>
```

Note the `focusable="false"` attribute on the SVG element above. In that case, since the icon is decorative, this will help assitive technology only announce the button's label.

### Button Styling
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Buttons are generally styled to look very button-like. They should look *pressable*. If you're looking for inspiration on fancy button styles, you'd do well looking at [the CodePen Topic on Buttons](https://codepen.io/topic/buttons/picks).

[![fancy-buttons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85415504-62974480-b53b-11ea-90d4-b08c6c536511.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85415504-62974480-b53b-11ea-90d4-b08c6c536511.png)

*[1](https://codepen.io/jouanmarcel/pen/RwweKqb), [2](https://codepen.io/Zeindelf/pen/vZbyEg), [3](https://codepen.io/wallas/pen/lFABr), [4](https://codepen.io/tmrDevelops/pen/VeRvKX), [5](https://codepen.io/DeptofJeffAyer/pen/waLYxy), [6](https://codepen.io/ARS/pen/vEwEPP)*

#### Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform Button Styles
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

How buttons look by default varies by browser and platform.

[![browser-buttons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85419033-92484b80-b53f-11ea-9368-b3a013deed27.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85419033-92484b80-b53f-11ea-9368-b3a013deed27.png)

*Just on macOS: Chrome, Safari, and Firefox (they look the same)*

[![button-no-borders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85419127-b015b080-b53f-11ea-99c7-3537f478fd5b.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85419127-b015b080-b53f-11ea-99c7-3537f478fd5b.png)

*Add `border: 0;` to those same buttons as above,a nd we have different styles entirely.*

While there is some UX truth to leaving the defaults of form elements alone so that they match that browser / platform's style and you get some [affordance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance) for free, designers typically don't like default styles, particularly ones that differ across browsers.

#### Resetting Default Button Style
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Removing all the styles from a button is easier than you think.

You'd think, as a form control, `appearance: none;` would help, but don't count on that. Actually `all: revert;` is a better bet to wipe the slate clean.

Here's a consolidated chunk of [what Normalize does](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/blob/master/normalize.css) to buttons:

```css
button {
  font-family: inherit;       /* for all browsers */
  font-size: 100%;            /* for all browsers */
  line-height: 1.15;          /* for all browsers */
  margin: 0;                  /* firefox and safari have margin */
  overflow: visible;          /* edge hides overflow */
  text-transform: none;       /* firefox inherits text-transform */
  -webkit-appearance: button; /* safari otherwise prevents some styles */
}

button::-moz-focus-inner {
  border-style: none;
  padding: 0;
}

button:-moz-focusring {
  outline: 1px dotted ButtonText;
}
```

#### A Consistent .button Class
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

In addition to [using reset or baseline CSS](https://css-tricks.com/reboot-resets-reasoning/), you may want to have a class for buttons that gives you a strong foundation for styling and works across both links and buttons.

```css
.button {
  border: 0;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
  background: #1e88e5;
  color: white;
  font-family: -system-ui, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.2;
  white-space: nowrap;
  text-decoration: none;
  padding: 0.25rem 0.5rem;
  margin: 0.25rem;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

[Check out this Pen](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/yjJwjL) to see why all these properties are needed to make sure it works correctly across elements.

#### Button States
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Just as with links, you'll want to style the states of buttons.

```css
button:hover { }
button:focus { }
button:active { }
button:visited { } /* maybe less so */
```

You may also want to [use ARIA attributes for styling](), which is a neat way to encourage using them correctly:

```css
button[aria-pressed="true"] { }
button[aria-pressed="false"] { }
```

#### Link-Styled Buttons
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

There are always exceptions. For example, a website in which you need a button-triggered action within a sentence:

```html
<p>
  You may open your <button>user settings</button> to change this.
</p>
```

We've used a button instead of an anchor tag in the above code, as this hypothetical website opens user settings in a modal dialog rather than linking to another page. In this situation, you may want to style the button as if it looks like a link.

This is probably rare enough that you would probably make a class (e.g. `.link-looking-button`) that incorporates the reset from above and otherwise matches what you do for anchor links.

#### Breakout Buttons
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Remember earlier when we talked about the possibility of wrapping entire elements in links? If you have a button within another element, but you want that *entire* outer element to be clickable / tappable as if it's the button, that's [a "breakout" button](https://css-tricks.com/breakout-buttons/). You can use an absolutely-positioned pseudo-element on the button to expand the clickable area to the whole region. See the [Semantic, progressively enhanced "break-out" button](https://codepen.io/andybelldesign/pen/NWKmqRm) Pen.

### Button JavaScript
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Even without JavaScript, button elements can be triggered by the `Space` and `Enter` keys on a keyboard. That's part of what makes them such appealing and useful elements: they are discoverable, focusable, and interactive with assistive technology in a predictable way.

#### Once Handlers
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Say a button does something pretty important, like submitting a payment. It would be pretty scary if it was programmed such that clicking the button multiple times submitted multiple payment requests. It is situations like this where you would attach a click handler to a button that only runs once. To make that clear to the user, we'll disable the button on click as well.

```js
document.querySelector('button')
  .addEventListener('click', event => {
    event.currentTarget
      .setAttribute('disabled', true);
  }, {
    once: true 
  });
```

Then, you would intentionally un-disable the button and reattach the handler when necessary.

#### Inline Handlers
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

JavaScript can be executed by activating a button through code on the button itself:

```html
<button onclick="console.log('clicked');">
  Log it.
</button>

<button onmousedown=""></button>
<button onmouseup=""></button>
```

That practice went from being standard practice to being a faux pas (not abstracting JavaScript functionality away from HTML) to, *eh, you need it when you need it.* One advantage is that if you're injecting this HTML into the DOM, you don't need to bind / re-bind JavaScript event handlers to it because it already has one.

#### JavaScript Frameworks
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

It's common in any JavaScript framework to make a component for handling buttons, as buttons typically have lots of variations. Those variations can be turned into an API of sorts. For example, in React:

```jsx
const Button = ({ className, children }) => {
  const [activated, setActivated] = React.useState(false);
  return (
    <button
      className={`button ${className}`}
      aria-pressed={activated ? 'true : 'false'}
      onClick={() => setActivated(!activated)}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

In that example, the `<Button />` component ensures the button will have a `button` class and handles a toggle-like active class.

### Button Accessibility
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

The biggest accessibility consideration with buttons is *actually using* buttons. Don't try to replicate a button with a `<div>` or a `<span>`, which is, unfortunately, more common than you might think. It's very likely that will cause problems. (Did you deal with focusability? Did you deal with keyboard events? Great. There's still probably more stuff you're forgetting.)

#### Focus Styles
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Like all focusable elements, browsers apply a default focus style, which is usually a blue outline.

[![button-focus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85422473-a55d1a80-b543-11ea-8173-12612e58cee8.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85422473-a55d1a80-b543-11ea-8173-12612e58cee8.png)

*Focus styles on Chrome/macOS*

While it's arguable that you should leave that alone as it's a very clear and obvious style for people that benefit from focus styles, it's also not out of the question to change it.

What you should *not* do is `button:focus { outline: 0; }` to remove it. If you ever remove a focus style liek that, put it babck at the same time.

```css
button:focus {
  outline: 0; /* removes the default blue ring */

  /* now, let's create our own focus style */
  border-radius: 3px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px red;
}
```

[![custom-button-focus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85422716-e7865c00-b543-11ea-9464-6d9199fae24b.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85422716-e7865c00-b543-11ea-9464-6d9199fae24b.png)

*Custom focus style*

The fact that a button may become focused when clicked and apply that style at the same time is offputting to some. There is a trick (that has limited, but increasing, [browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-focus-visible)) on removing focus styles from clicks and not keyboard events:

```css
:focus:not(:focus-visible) {
  outline: 0;
}
```

#### ARIA
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Buttons already have the `role` they need (`role="button"`). But there are some other ARIA attributes that are related to buttons:

* `aria-pressed`: turns a button into a **toggle**, between `aria-pressed="true"` and `aria-pressed="false"`.
  * [More on button toggles](https://inclusive-components.design/toggle-button/), which can also be done with `role="switch"` and `aria-checked="true"`.
* `aria-expanded`: if the button controls the open / closed state of another element (like a dropdown menu), you apply this attribute to indicate that like `aria-expanded="true"`.
* `aria-label`: overrides the text within the button.
  * This is useful for labeling buttons that otherwise don't have text, but you're still probably better off using a `visually-hidden` class so it can be translated.
* `aria-labelledby`: points to an element that will act as the label for the button.

For the last one:

```html
<button aria-labelledby="buttonText">
  Time is running out!
  <span id="buttonText">Add to Cart</span>
</button>
```

Deque has [a deeper dive blog post into button accessibility](https://www.deque.com/blog/accessible-aria-buttons/) that includes much about ARIA.

#### Dialogs
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

If a button opens a dialog, your job is to [move the focus inside and trap it there](https://css-tricks.com/a-css-approach-to-trap-focus-inside-of-an-element/). When closing the dialog, you ened to return focus back to that button so the user is back exactly where they started. This makes the experience of using a modal the same for someone who relies on assistive technology as for someone who doesn't.

Focus management isn't just for dialogs, either. If clicking a button runs a calculation and changes a value on the page, there is no context change there, meaning focus should remain on the button. If the button does something like "move to next page", the focus should be moved to the start of that next page.

#### Size
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Don't make buttons too small. That goes for links and any sort of interactive control. People with any sort of reduced dexterity [will benefit](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/controls/).

The classic Apple guideline for the [minimum size for a touch target](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/) (button) is `44 x 44pt`.

[![button-size](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85435846-14436f00-b556-11ea-8978-e49520e602ee.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85435846-14436f00-b556-11ea-8978-e49520e602ee.png)

[Here's some guidelines from other companies](https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1085). [Fitt's Law](https://adrianroselli.com/2019/06/target-size-and-2-5-5.html#Fitts) tells us smaller targets have greater error rates. [Google even takes button sizes into consideration](https://web.dev/tap-targets/) when evaluating the SEO of a site.

In addition to ample size, [don't place buttons too close to each other](https://a11yproject.com/posts/large-touch-targets/), whether they're stacked vertically or together on the same line. Give them some margin because people experiencing motor control issues run the risk of clicking the wrong one.

#### Activating Buttons
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Buttons work by being clicked / touched or by pressing the `Enter` or `Space` keys when focused. Even if you add `role="button"` to a link or div, you wn't get the spacebar functionality, so at the risk of beating a dead horse, use `<button>` in those cases.
