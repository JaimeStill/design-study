There is a lot to know about links and buttons in HTML. THere is markup implementation and related attributes, styleing best practices, things to avoid, and even-more-nuanced cousins of the link: buttons and button-like inputs.

> Quick **guidelines** on when to use each:
> * Are you giving a user a way to go to another page or a different part of the same page? Use a **link** (`<a href="/somewhere">link</a>`)
> * Are you making a JavaScript-powered clickable action? Use a **button** (`<button type="button">button</button>`)
> * Are you submitting a form? Use a **submit input** (`<input type="submit" value="Submit">`)

## Links
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Links are one of the most basic, yet deeply fundamental and foundational building blocks of the web. Click a link, and you move to another page or are moved to another place within the same page.

### Link HTML
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

#### Basic Links
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

```html
<a href="https://css-tricks.com">CSS Tricks</a>
```

A link to a "fully qualitifed" or "absolute" URL.

#### Relative Links
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

```html
<a href="/pages/about.html">About</a>
```

Relative URLs are most useful for things like navigation, but be careful of suing them within content - like blog posts - where that content may be read off-site, like in an app or RSS feed.

#### Jump Links
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Links can also be "hash links" or "jump links" by starting with a `#`:

```html
<a href="#section-2">Section Two</a>
<section id="section-2"></section>
```

Clicking that link will "jump" (scroll) to the first element in the DOM with an ID that matches, like the section element above.

> **Trick**: Using a hash link (e.g. `#0`) in development can be useful so you can click the link without being sent back to the top of the page like a click on a `#` link does. But careful, links that don't link anywhere should never make it to production.

> **Trick**: Jump-links can sometimes benefit from [smooth scrolling](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/) to help people understand that the page is moving from one place to another.

It's a fairly common UI/UX thing to see a "Back to top" link on sites, particularly where important navigational controls are at the top but there is quite a bit of content to scroll (or otherwise navigate) through. To create a jump link, link to the ID of an element that is at the top of the page where it makes sense to send focus back to.

```html
<a href="#top-of-page">Back to Top</a>
```

Jump links are sometimes also used to link to other anchor (`<a>`) elements that have no `href` attribute. Thos are called "placeholder" links:

```html
<a id="section-2"></a>
<h3>Section 2</h3>
```

There are [accessibility considerations](https://www.scottohara.me/note/2019/07/17/placeholder-link.html) of these, but overall they are acceptable.

#### Disabled Links
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

A link without an `href` is the only [practical way](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-disable-links/) to disable a link. Why disable a link? Perhaps it's a link that only becomes active after logging in or signing up.

```css
a:not[href] {
  /* style a "disabled" link */
}
```

When a link has no `href`, there is no role, no focusability, and no keyboard events. This is intentional. You could think of it like a `<span>`.

#### Open in New Tab
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Do you need to open in a new window or tab? You can use the `target` attribute for that, but it's [strongly discouraged](https://adrianroselli.com/2020/02/link-targets-and-3-2-5.html).

```html
<a href="https://css-tricks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS Tricks</a>
```

The bit that makes it work is `target="_blank"`, but note the extra `rel` attribute and values there which [make it safer](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/) and [faster](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/performance-benefits-of-rel-noopener/).

Making links open in new tabs is a major UX discussion. We have [a whole article about when to use it here](https://css-tricks.com/use-target_blank/). Summarized:

Don't use it:

* Because you or your client prefer it personally.
* Because you're trying to beef up your time on site metric.
* Because you're distinguishing between internal and external links or content types.
* Because it's your way of dealing with infinite scroll trickiness.

Do use it:

* Because a user is doing something on the current page, like actively playing media or has unsaved work.
* You have some obscure technical reason why you are forced to (even then you're stll probably the rule, not the exception).

#### Trigger a Download
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Need the link to trigger a download? [The download attribute](https://css-tricks.com/building-good-download-button/) on a link will instruct the browser to download the linked file rather than opening it within the current page / tab. It's a nice UX touch.

```html
<a href="/files/file.pdf" download>Download PDF</a>
```

#### The rel Attribute
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

This attribute is for the relationship of the link to the target.

The `rel` attribute is also commonly used on the `<link>` element (which is not used for creating hyperlinks, but for things like including CSS and preloading). We're not including `rel` values for the `<link>` element here, just anchor links.

Here are some basic examples:

```html
<a href="/page/3" rel="next">Next</a>
<a href="/page/1" rel="prev">Previous</a>

<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" rel="license">cc by 2.0</a>

<a href="/topics/" rel="directory">All Topics</a>
```

* `rel="alternate"`: alternate version of the document.
* `rel="author"`: author of the document.
* `rel="help"`: a resource for help with the document.
* `rel="license"`: license and legal information.
* `rel="manifest"`: web app manifest document.
* `rel="next"`: next document in the series.
* `rel="prev"`: previous document in the series.
* `rel="search"`: a document meant to perform a search in the current document.

There are some `rel` attributes specifically to [inform search engines](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/96569?hl=en):

* `rel="sponsored"`: mark links that are advertisements or paid placements (commonly called paid links) as sponsored.
* `rel="ugc"`: for not-particularly-trusted user-generated content, like comments and forum posts.
* `rel="nofollow"`: tell the search engine to ignore this and not associate this site with where this links to.

And also some `rel` attributes that are most security-focused:

* `rel="noopener"`: prevent a new tab from using the JavaScript `window.opener` feature, which could potentially access the page containing the link (your site) to perform malicious things, like stealing information or sharing infected code. Using this with `target="_blank"` is [often a good idea](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/performance-benefits-of-rel-noopener/).
* `rel="noreferrer"`: prevent other sites or tracking services (e.g. Google Analytics) from identifying your page as the source of clicked link.

You can use multiple space-separated values if you need to (e.g. `rel="noopener noreferrer"`).

And finally, some `rel` attributes come from [the microformats standard](http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-faq#How_is_rel_used) and the [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/rel-me) like:

* `rel="directory"`: indicates that the destination of the hyperlink is a directory listing containing an entry for the current page.
* `rel="tag"`: indicates that the destination of that hyperlink is an author-designated "tag" (or keyword / subject) for the current page.
* `rel="payment"`: indicates that the destination of that hyperlink provides a way to show or give support for the current page.
* `rel="help"`: states that the resource linked to is a help file or FAQ for the current document.
* `rel="me"`: indicates that its destination represents the same person or entity as the current page.

#### ARIA roles
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

The default role of a link is `link`, so you do *not* need to do:

```html
<a role="link" href="/">Link</a>
```

You'd only need that if you were faking a link, which would be a weird / rare thing to ever need to do, and you'd have to use some JavaScript in addition to this to make it actually follow the link.

```html
<span class="link" tabindex="0" role="link" data-href="/">
  Fake accessible link created using a span
</span>
```

Just looking above you can see how much extra work faking a link is, and that is before you consider that it breaks right-clicking, doesn't allow opening in a new tab, doesn't work with Windows High Contrast Mode and other reader modes and assistive technology. Pretty bad!

A useful ARIA role to [indicate the current]() page, like:

```html
<a href="/" aria-current="page">Home</a>
<a href="/contact">Contact</a>
<a href="/about">About</a>
```


#### Should You Use the title Attribute?
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

[Probably not](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title#Accessibility_concerns). Save this for giving an `iframe` a short, descriptive title.

```html
<a title="I don't need to be here" href="/">
  List of Concerts
</a>
```

`title` provides a hover-triggered UI popup showing the text you wrote. You can't style it, and it's [not really that accessible](https://www.24a11y.com/2017/the-trials-and-tribulations-of-the-title-attribute/).

Hover-triggered is the key phrase here. It's unusuable on any touch-only device. If a link needs more contextual information, provide that in actual content around the link, or use descriptive text for the link itself (as opposed to something like "Click Here").

#### Icon-only Links
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

If a link only has an icon inside it, like:

```html
<a href="/">😲</a>

<a href="/">
  <svg>...</svg>
</a>
```

That isn't enough contextual information about the link, particularly for accessibility reasons, but [potentially for anybody](https://thomasbyttebier.be/blog/the-best-icon-is-a-text-label). Links with text are almost always more clear. If you absolutely can't use text, you can use a pattern like:

```html
<a href="/">
  <svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false">...</svg>
  <span class="visual-hidden">Useful link text</span>
</a>
```

`visually-hidden` is a class used to visually hide the label text with CSS:

```css
.visually-hidden {
  border: 0;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  height: 1px;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 0;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}
```

Unlike `aria-label`, visually hidden text can be translated and will hold up better in [specialized browsing modes](https://css-tricks.com/reader-mode-the-button-to-beat/).

#### Links Around Images
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Images can be links if you wrap them in a link. There is no need to use the alt text to say the image is a link, as assitive technology will do that already.

```html
<a href="/buy/puppies/now">
  <img src="puppy.jpg" alt="A happy puppy.">
</a>
```

#### Links Around Bigger Chunks of Content
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

You can link a whole area of content, like:

```html
<a href="/article/">
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Card</h2>
    <img src="..." alt="...">
    <p>Content</p>
  </div>
</a>
```

But of course, there are UX implications. For example, it can be harder to select the text, and the entire element needs fairly complex styling to create clear focus and hover states. There are also [accessibility implications](https://adrianroselli.com/2020/02/block-links-cards-clickable-regions-etc.html), like the fact that the content of the entire card is read before it is announced as a link.

### Link Styling
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Here's the default look of a link:

[![default-link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85331137-92930900-b4a3-11ea-9844-cf3d448e41ab.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85331137-92930900-b4a3-11ea-9844-cf3d448e41ab.png)

It's likely you'll be changing the style of your links,a nd alos likely you'll use CSS to do it, I could make all my links red in CSS by doing:

```css
a {
  color: red;
}
```

Sometimes selecting and styling *all* links on a page is a bit heavy-handed, as links in navigation might be treated entirely differently than links within text. You can always *scope* selectors to target links within particular areas like:

```css
/* navigation links */
nav a { }

/* links in an article */
article a { }

/* links contained in an element with a "text" class */
.text a { }
```

Or select the link directly to style.

```css
.link {
  /* for styling <a class="link" href="/"> */
}

a[aria-current="page"] {
  /*
    you'll need to apply this attribute yourself, but it's
    a great pattern to use for active navigation.
  */
}
```

#### Link States
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

* `:hover`: for styling when a mouse pointer is over a link.
* `:visited`: for styling when the link has been followed, as best as the browser can remember.
  * it has limited stiling ability due to security.
* `:link`: for styling when a link has *not* been visited.
* `:active`: for styling when the link is pressed (e.g. the mouse button is donw or the element is being tapped on a touch screen).
* `:focus`: very important! Links should always have a focus style. If you choose to remove the default blue outline that most browsers apply, also use this selector to [re-apply a visually obvious focus style](https://css-tricks.com/focusing-on-focus-styles/).

These are chainable like any pseudo-class, so you could do something like this if it is useful for your design / UX:

```css
/* style focus and hover states in a single ruleset */
a:focus:hover { }
```

#### Links as Buttons
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

You can style a link to look button-like. Perhaps some of the confusion between links and buttons is stuff like this:

[![button-link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85332636-4e553800-b4a6-11ea-8936-50db3ff239c6.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85332636-4e553800-b4a6-11ea-8936-50db3ff239c6.png)

*Very cool "button" style from [Katherine Kato](https://codepen.io/kathykato/pen/gOOjgmP)*

That certainly looks like a button! Everyone would call that a button. Even a design system would likely call that a button and perhaps have a class like `.button { }`. But! A think you can click that says "Learn More" is [very much a link, not a button](https://css-tricks.com/css-basics-styling-links-like-boss/). THat's completely fine, it's just yet another reminder to use the semantically and functionally correct element.

#### Color Contrast
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Since we often style links with a distinct color, it's important to use a color with sufficient color contrast for accessibility. There is a wide variety of visual impairments (see the tool [WhoCanUse](https://whocanuse.com/) for simulating color combinations with different impairments) and high contrast helps nearly all of them.

Perhaps you set a blue color for links:

[![blue-link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85332944-ce7b9d80-b4a6-11ea-9d05-ca7d59a22249.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85332944-ce7b9d80-b4a6-11ea-9d05-ca7d59a22249.png)

*The blue link is `#2196f3`*

While that might look OK to you, it's better to use tools for testing to ensure the color has a strong enough ratio according to [researched guidelines](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/accessible-styles#color_and_contrast). Here, I'll look at Chrome DevTools and it will tell me this color is not compliant in that it doesn't have enough contrast with the background color behind it:

[![bad-contrast-ratio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85333260-477af500-b4a7-11ea-8e5a-0bf6dc0f8ff2.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14102723/85333260-477af500-b4a7-11ea-8e5a-0bf6dc0f8ff2.png)

*Chrome DevTools is telling us this link color does **not** have enough contrast*.

Color contrast is a big consideration with links, not just because they are often colored in a unique color that needs to be checked, but because they have all those different states(hover, focus, active, visited) which also might have different colors. Compound that with the fact that text can be selected and you've got a lot of placed to consider contrast. [Here's an article about all that](https://css-tricks.com/a-whole-bunch-of-places-to-consider-contrast-in-a-single-paragraph/).

#### Styling Types of Links
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

We can get clever in CSS with attribute selectors and figure out what kind of resource a link is pointing to, assuming the `href` value has useful stuff in it.

```css
/* style all links that include .pdf at the end */
a[href$=".pdf"]::after {
  content: " (PDF)";
}

/* style links that point to Google */
a[href*="google.com"] {
  color: purple;
}
```

#### Styling Links for Print
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

CSS has an ["at-rule"](https://css-tricks.com/the-at-rules-of-css/) for declaring styles that only take effect on printed media (e.g. printing out a web page). You can include them in any CSS like this:

```css
@media print {
  aritcle a::after {
    content: " (" attr(href) ")";
  }
}
```

#### Resetting Styles
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

If you needed to take all the styling off a link (or really any other element for that matter), CSS provides a way to remove all the styles using the `all` property:

```css
.special-area a {
  all: unset;
  all: revert;

  /* start from scratch */
  color: purple;
}
```

You can also remove individual styles with keywords. (Again this isn't really unique to links, but is generically useful):

```css
a {
  /* grab color from nearest parent that sets it */
  color: inherit;

  /* wipe out style (turn black) */
  color: initial;

  /* change back to User Agent style (blue) */
  color: revert;
}
```

### Link JavaScript
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Say you wanted to stop the clicking of a link from doing what it normally does: go to that link or jump around the page. In JavaScript, you can use `preventDefault` to prevent jumping around.

```js
const jumpLinks = document.querySelectorAll("a[href^='#']");

jumpLinks.forEach(link => {
  link.addEventListener('click', event => {
    event.preventDefault();
    // do something else instead, like handle the navigation behavior yourself
  });
});
```

This kind of thing is at the core of how "Single Page Apps" (SPAs) work. They intercept the clicks so browsers don't take over and handle the navigation.

SPAs see where you are trying to go (within your own site), load the data they need, replace what they need to on the page, and update the URL. It's an awful lot of work to replicate what the browser does for free, but you get the ability to do things like animate between pages.

Another JavaScript concern with links is that, when a link to another page is clicked, the page is left and another page loads. That can be problematic for something like a page that contains a form the user is filling out but hasn't completed. If they click the link and leave the page, they lose their work! Your only opportunity to prevent the user from leaving is by using the `beforeunload` event:

```js
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', event => {
  // Remind the user to save their work or whatever.
});
```

A link that has had its default behavior removed won't announce the new destination. This means a person using assistive technology may not know where they wound up. You'll have to do thinkgs like update the page's title and move focus back up to the top of the document.

#### JavaScript Frameworks
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

In a JavaScript framework, like [React](https://css-tricks.com/guides/react/), you might sometimes see links created from something like a `<Link />` component rather than a native `<a>` element. The custom component probably creates a native `<a>` element, but with extra functionality, like enabling the JavaScript router to work, and adding attributes like `aria-current="page"` as needed, which is a good thing!

Ultimately, a link is a link. A JavaScript framework might offer or encourage some level of abstraction, but you're always free to use regular links.

### Link Accessibility
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

We covered some accessibility in the sections above (it's all related!), but here are some more things to think about:

* You don't need text like "Link" or "Go to" in the link text itself. Make the text meaningful ("documentation" instead of "click here").
* Links already have an ARIA role by default (`role="link"`) so there's no need to explicitly set it.
* Try not to use the URL itself as the text(`<a href="google.com">google.com</a>).
* Links are *generally* blue and *generally* underlined and that's [generally good](https://adrianroselli.com/2016/06/on-link-underlines.html).
* All images in content should have `alt` text anyway, but doubly so when the image is wrappe din a link with otherwise no text.

#### Unique Accessible Names
[Back to Top](#links-and-buttons)

Some assistive technology can create **lists of interactive elements on the page**. Imagine a group of four article cards that all have a "Read More", the list of interactive elements will be like:

* Read More
* Read More
* Read More
* Read More

Not very useful. You could make use of that `.visually-hidden` calss we covered to make the links more like:

```html
<a href="/article">
  Read More
  <span class="visually-hidden">
    of the article "Dancing with Rabbits".
  </span>
</a>
```

Now each link is unique and clear. If the design can support it, do it *without* the visually hidden class to remove the ambiguity for everyone.
